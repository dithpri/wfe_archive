The Yamato Empire is a Commonwealth-style sovereign entity uniting Japan, the State of Sankai, and other territories under a shared imperial framework. Rooted in Japan&#146;s historical and spiritual legacy, it functions as a federation of autonomous states bound by mutual sovereignty, cultural heritage, and strategic cooperation. While each territory maintains local governance, the Empire shares a unified military alliance, economic zone, and foreign policy coordination to ensure collective strength and stability. With Tokyo as the imperial seat and Iwaya-no-Miya as Sankai&#146;s spiritual and administrative heart, the Yamato Empire represents the seamless fusion of tradition, autonomy, and imperial unity.
