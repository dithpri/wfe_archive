Have you ever wandered around nationstates, trying to find a democratic region? Find one filled with fascists, kings, communists, and others like that? I have too, and I&#39;ve decided to make sure that never happens again. Here in The True Republic, we will not allow the region to become overgrown by fascists, and others like them. We also have an extensive role play, even making fake regions to have a Foreign Relations with. So, do you want true freedom? A constitution followed? Then move here, you&#39;re always welcomed!
