[b][u][color=#FFFF00]THE[/color] [color=#00FF00]WORLD[/color] [color=#0040FF]OF[/color] [color=#FF8000]ARCADIA[/color][/b][/u]

The world of Arcadia is a Role-Playing community, and [color=#FF0000]we do so with modern tech,[/color] so if you are past tech, future tech, or any other tech, this region is sadly not for you. [color=#FF0000]However,[/color] some mythical creatures, i.e. Drakes, are allowed if they are approved by a regional admin for example Drakonivali and United Arkaine. Some technology, such as weapons that do not exist yet, can be granted if sent to a regional admin as well. Remember, [color=#FF0000]keep the Role-Play PG-13 or lower[/color] or it WILL be suppressed.
