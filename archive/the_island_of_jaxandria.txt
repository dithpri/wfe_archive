The Island of Jaxandria is a refuge from tyranny, welcome to any nation who wishes to join.

With a history long filled with violence and intrigue, the Island is now home to a peaceful people.  
These people allow any who wish to remain on the Island to remain as long as they wish, so long as all remain civil and orderly.

The Island is currently home to the exiled nations of the Confederation of Independent States, who claim to be the rightfull rulers of the Confederation of Nations.
