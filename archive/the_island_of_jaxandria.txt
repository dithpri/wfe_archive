On March 7th, 2015, the Syrillian Liberation Force launched Operation Resonance, resulting in the liberation of the Island of Jaxandria. 

The Island of Jaxandria had previously been the only region targeted for liberation that remained occupied after Operation Overthrow, executed on December 8th, 2014. The Bordurian Empire and Syrillia then engaged in negotiations that would have resulted in the voluntary liberation of the Island of Jaxandria, in exchange for the withdrawal of Syrillian troops from several regions that were formerly insular provinces of the Bordurian Empire. Those negotiations broke down suddenly and unexpectedly, resulting in the immediate formation of Operation Resonance.
