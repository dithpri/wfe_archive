Welcome to the [color=#4526c9]Greater[/color] [color=#dd1b1b]Ohio[/color] [color=#02deff]Confederation![/color]
Here, you can find regions spanning Ohio, the Great Lakes, and the Ohio River Valley!
With a central capital based in Toledo, a major city on Lake Erie, the government is found here.

You can take part in the government too! By winning an election, or being appointed by the leader or parliament. If this happens, you can take part in our nation&#39;s government. Our current leader is the Erie Confederation.
The WA position is currently unoccupied, but whoever the first person is to be the WA delagate, they will be honored from now till, well, forever!
