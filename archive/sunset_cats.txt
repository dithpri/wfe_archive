Thunder crashes overhead as the two warring factions clash again. The night air is cool and damp and almost peaceful as lions and coyotes battle. A roar rings out. A small lion, called to battle too early, looks down from his place in a tree, watching a coyote&#39;s body drop to the ground. He thinks back to how this all started.

[i]There was peace in the land. Two lions stood up on a tall rock looking at the rest of the pride. There are maybe fifteen or twenty of these stones all across the lions&#39; land, one for each pride that shares it. [/i]
