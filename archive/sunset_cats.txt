[i]It&#39;s a sunny morning. Suddenly, a massive roar shakes the ground. The alpha male steps up to Sunset Rock. His mate carries two squirming cubs to the front. &quot;I give you,&quot; growls the alpha, &quot;Wind and Storm!&quot; Time passes. The pride has eaten their fill, and night has fallen. Two small noses poke out of the den and run down the hill. Neither speaks. Suddenly, blood splatters the night. [/i]A coyote.[i] Wind sinks to his paws with a muffled whimper, pushing his muzzle into his sister&#39;s pelt. Then it is morning again, and the alpha has something to announce. Wind sighs, dragging his paws out of the den and to the clearing below Sunset Rock. The alpha sighs. &quot;Sunset Pride,&quot; he growls, &quot;we are at war with the coyotes.&quot;[/i]
