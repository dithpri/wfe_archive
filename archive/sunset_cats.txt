From the sunrise to sunset, the cats are always watching for visitors and friends to come and join! But as the region gets bigger, and the slow sun comes through, the cries of death and help run through the cracks of the earth, the army rises and takes the place, &quot;WE AREN&#39;T SMALL! WE ARE ALL A TEAM!!&quot; as long as the sun stays up, the rest of us will be safe.
