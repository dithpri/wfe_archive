Shipwreck Cove be a pirate haven. I, Captain Septimus Katyor, be the captain. We aren&amp;#39;t yet raidin&amp;#39;, on account of how small we be, though we might in the future. The first eight nations to join will become pirate lords. I myself be the Pirate Lord of the Caspian Sea. Our flag has the flag of Henry Morgan in the corner, along with a red stripe for each pirate lord.
