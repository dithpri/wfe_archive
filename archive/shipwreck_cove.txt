   Shipwreck Cove be a pirate haven. I, Captain Septimus Katyor, be the captain. We aren&amp;#39;t yet raidin&amp;#39;, on account of how small we be, though we might in the future. The first eight nations to join will become pirate lords. We got eight crews of swashbuckiling layabouts.
    I myself be the Pirate Lord of the Caspian Sea, The Seagoin&amp;#39; Horde of Piratical Islanders has lain claim to the  Mediterranean, The Disputed Territories of Space Pirates has chosen the Carribean, The Oppressed Peoples of Kraken Spear claims the South China Sea, The Fleet of the Black Scourge governs the Black Sea, and Monkey Pirate Island be the lord o&amp;#39; the Adriatic. The Armed Republic of PirateLand hasn&amp;#39; started rulin&amp;#39; yet.
