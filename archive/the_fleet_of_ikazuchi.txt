[i]Our raiding policy[/i]
We, as a strictly non-WA region, prefer to raid regions in a non-orthodox way, by spamming the &quot;Create&quot; button and invading them. This method generates alot of bots, which can be used to raid others. However, if you are interested in joining, TG [nation]Ikazuchi[/nation] for the password.
