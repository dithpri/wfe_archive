[color=#052d52]The Bay of Plenty is a region of New Zealand, situated around a bight of the same name in the northern coast of the North Island.

Tauranga, the main city in the Bay of Plenty region, began with humble beginnings in the 1830s and struggled through the M&amp;#257;ori land wars. Today it is a flourishing port city. The Bay of Plenty region covers 12,200 km&sup2; of land and 9,500 km&sup2; of coastal marine area.

With white beaches, clear waters, and pleasant weather, the Bay of Plenty was a major tourist destination. Today, however, it&#39;s a bit colder than usual...[/color]
