Workers of the world, since the Industrial Revolution, our socialist, ecological, and communist values have been undermined by hollow wokism and radical feminism. It&#39;s time to stand firm, defend our nations, our families and restore the true spirit of progress. Let us unite to build a better future for our countries. Workers of the world, unite!
