Judea is the ancient soul and living heartbeat ,the land where prophecy was spoken, kings were anointed, and the covenant between God and His people was first sealed in stone. From king David to the songs of king Solomon
Today, Judea rises again not rebuilt, but reborn.its people walk with the strength of those who remember where they came from. The covenant lives in their hands, the fire of prophecy in their hearts.
Though its roots are deeply Jewish, its spirit calls to all who honor the One Creator. Here, Jews, Christians, and all seekers of truth find common ground &#151; not in conquest, but in reverence. 
&#147;The Lord shall give strength unto His people; the Lord shall bless His people with peace.&#148;
