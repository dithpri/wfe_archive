This region is dedicated to traditional Japanese values, according to the [i]Meiji[/i] constitution.

We expect an absolute veneration of our Emperor, a direct descendent of the goddess [i]Amaterasu[/i].
Filial piety and loyalty are the supreme virtues of the subjects of the imperial state. 
We reject individualism, liberalism and materialism.

We follow the [i][url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokutai]Kokutai[/url][/i] (nationalism)  and [i][url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakk%C5%8D_ichiu]Hakko ichiu[/url][/i] (imperialism) doctrines.

This region is now inactive but still stand as a testimony of the greatness of the Empire of Japan.
We are proud of our traditions and will never forget Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
