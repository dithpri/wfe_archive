The Mojave Wasteland is a harsh place, a barren, scorched desert that has been cooking since Before the Bombs Fell. Factions fought, people starved, were raped and killed, and any hope of humanity was long lost. But then, House came and civilized it all. But House didn&#39;t care for the little guy. And so the Courier came, and drove out the Invaders, put House in his place, and established the Mojave Pact, a Commonwealth dedicated to education, healthcare, protection, and liberty. It will succeed.
