We are located in the Far North Arctic &amp; the only way you can access it is entering a Magical Dimensional Rift. It needs special powers to enter it and only the Founder (who is also the Governor) can grant you that Power. Our Long-Term Goals are many but the Primary ones are: Extreme Environmental Beauty, Excellent Eco-Friendliness, Peacefulness, and Lowest Crime Rates Possible including Youth Rebelliousness.
We also reject the World Assembly &amp; Ancient Wisdom is a guiding force for our Region.
