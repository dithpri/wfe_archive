A small region of countries that are somehow both sworn enemies and close friends at all times. Mostly close friends.

Also basically home to a couple goofs from ovipets that just want to giggle at their messes of simulated countries.

In keeping with the silly theme, it is common for the message board to be filled with remarks about nation animals, accusations of pie-thievery, and all-around shenanigans of as ridiculously silly or innocent nature as possible.
