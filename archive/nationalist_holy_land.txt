The liberated lands of [region]Nationalist Holy Land[/region], we have returned and are rebuilding from our Marxist invaders, those who came for our families, those who burned our homelands to the ground, those who exiled our people, our leaders, and our heroes. They stand no more atop the graves of our forebearers, instead their bodies are shipped back to the pits of hell in peices, their flags are burned at the stake of justice, and their people will pay for our suffering! 

Our people fight, our people die, and our people survive for the Fatherland!

Hail Grand Marshal [nation]Eurogoslavia[/nation]! Glory to [region]Nationalist Holy Land[/region]!
