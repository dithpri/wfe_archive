This region is for fellowship between Christians who uphold and defend the doctrines of historical Christianity, as expressed in, among others, the Five Solas and the five doctrines of grace.

We have a high view of Scripture and stand opposed to ecumenicism and compromise. [b]We are not supporters of the CRCA, in which professing Christians stand shoulder to shoulder with false religion, contrary to the clear Word of God.[/b]

Others are welcome to join, but are requested to respect the overall ethos of this region.
