This region is dedicated as a monument for Greek nationalism and the Metaxas Regime&#39;s legacy during its time in power of the Kingdom of Greece. This region is loyal to all Nationalist and Fascist regions as a means of confronting the threat that is Communism and Anarchism.

We formally reject [region]Antifa[/region] influence as it is a left wing populist group that seeks to undermine all right wing movements, including our own. We will do anything that is necessary to prevent this region from being overrun by the radical Left wing (Communism and Anarchism) and far right wing (Nazism/ National Socialism).
