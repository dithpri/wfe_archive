This region is dedicated as a monument for Greek nationalism and the Metaxas Regime&#39;s legacy during its time in power of the Kingdom of Greece. This region is loyal to all Nationalist and Fascist regions as a means of confronting the threats of Communism, National Socialism (Nazism) and Anarchism.

We formally reject [region]Antifa[/region] influence as it is a left-wing populist group that seeks to undermine all right-wing movements, including our own. We will do anything that is necessary to prevent this region from being overrun by the radical left-wing (Communism and Anarchism) and far right-wing (Nazism/ National Socialism).
