We look to the sky and see many creatures flying through the air, wishing we could be as free as they are. Yet we also see ourselves as supreme beings, knowing we were meant to be as free as we want while on the levels of the Earth.

&amp;quot;I have wanted to be able to fly,&amp;quot; says your eldest daughter, &amp;quot;But I&amp;#39;m more comfortable on the ground.&amp;quot;

Freedom is precious, freedom is grand. Giving in to the Corrupted Shadows will make you fall. Standing by the side of the Frozen Darkness will help you rise o the heights of the eternal sky.
