An island nation founded by Russian and Finnish raiders, with it&amp;#39;s own unique ecosystem different from most other areas of the world. It remained in a state similar to medieval times until the end of the first world war, when it was officially exposed to the outside world thanks to German Luftwaffe forces. Since then, Asyl and it&amp;#39;s inhabitants have become a major military power, known for excessive brutality and strange materials found only rarely outside of Asyl. The nations-the Trewhittian Commonwealth and Vyntraskan Republic-have endured a near-constant war with Asyl&amp;#39;s ecology and two civil wars, but have done well despite these facts.
