[color=0d5eaf][b][u]Official Announcement from the Secretary of Defence of Thaecia[/u]

Friends, it is time for Thaecia to take a new course, to fulfil a new niche on the global stage. Dissatisfied with being weak &amp; spineless unaligneds, it is the decision of the Thaecian government to officially condone griefing regions.

For too long, [i]evil[/i] natives have terrorised raiding &amp; defending gameplay, and the Thaempirial Army says this reign of terror must come to an end, and can only be destroyed through the banjection of all natives of regions we occupy. This policy will be coded into Thaecian law, effective immediately.[hr]
