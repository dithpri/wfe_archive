Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, and Louisiana make up the Eastern United States which make up the area often known as the Southern United States. 

***PLEASE READ***

I welcome all nations, of course, but it would be awesome if people who join this region create a nation using the states listed above. Not West Virginia of course, because that&amp;#39;s me. 

For example, someone could create a nation called &amp;quot;Florida&amp;quot;, and instead of roleplaying as a ruler or president or prime minister, they could roleplay as a governor!
