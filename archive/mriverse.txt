A collection of nine pocket universes collectively called the Mriverse. Governed from MV-1 from the planet Nika the people of the Mriverse move with ease from universe to universe. While currently the people of the Mriverse are content with their own realms, it is possible for them to venture out and claim others and create new pocket universes of those territories.
