  Greetings nations of NationStates. I am Emperor Phoenixius Midorian the 1st, of The Beautonian Empire from the Midorian Dynasty of Beautonia. I am here to offer you an application for my region named Heavens Ridge. Heavens Ridge is very sunny and warm but winters are cold and snowy. You get a taste of every season. To the south, there are mountains with large snow caps and glaciers. To the west are the many Great Lakes of Heavens Ridge. To the east is a great beach spanning from east to west where you can enjoy the sea. And finally, in the middle of Heavens Ridge is the Island of the Imperial Territory Of Beautonia, in which I, Emperor Phonexius Midorian the 1st lives. Please join us in our beautiful region of Heavens Ridge.
