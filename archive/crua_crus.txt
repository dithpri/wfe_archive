On the day 09/10-16 started a poll about if the region should send a atomic bomb against Crustavi and the poll enden 11/10-16 (21:23) and had 100% on sending a nuclear bomb against Crustavi. It was a low budget on the construction of the atomic bomb and it made the stability of the rocket unsteady, so the rocket ended up crashing in the sea 200 mil outside of Crustavi capitalcity.
