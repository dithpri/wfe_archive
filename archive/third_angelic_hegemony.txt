Welcome to the inter-regional interactions page of the Third Angelic Hegemony. Here, you can find all of the subordinates of the Hegemony, as well as the Hegemon, [nation=long]The Arken[/nation]. However, some subordinates may be out on missions for diplomatic reasons. 

Should you wish to join, there is no World Assembly requirement, but, as a Hegemony system, you must recognize [nation]The Arken[/nation] as Hegemon and Supreme Power. It is also preferable to have low civil rights and high religiousness, although this is not a requirement. The tech level is in the Steam Age.
