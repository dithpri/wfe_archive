The Region of the UK-DPRK (United Kingdom - Democratic People&amp;#39;s Republic of Korea) is a vast nation of mountains and rain forests, populated by wombats and little critters that resemble Kim Jong Il. The Queen herself and the Great Leader Kim Jong Il decided to unite the nations after seeing all others as impervious.

Now, the current leader, Hans Landa, took control. He refers to his citizens as &amp;quot;My Little Playthings&amp;quot; and restricts rights for everyone. What a happy Region!
