[quote=sovietcong;50868543][b]The Party has noticed that imperialism has sunken several of its rotten teeth into the youthful flesh of our Revolution.[/b] But thanks to our ongoing struggle, we managed to weed them out! Make sure you see them, make sure your finger is pointing at them, for they are the ones who wish to usurp these fertile fields for themselves and themselves only, turning them into the next mindless cogs in their war-mongering machinery of death and destruction![/quote]
