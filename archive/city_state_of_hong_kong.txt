[i] The name [b]Hong Kong[/b] comes from its main export product from the colonial period. The pau-de-&aacute;guila, a dark, fragrant resinous wood used in incense and perfume, was this product. Its constant presence in the city&#39;s port has earned it the nickname &quot;fragrant port&quot; (in Cantonese it is &quot;tr&amp;#7847;m h&amp;#432;&amp;#417;ng&quot; - Romanization of Cantonese; &quot;h&amp;#275;ungg&oacute;ng&quot;). At a given time in history, the nickname of the port became the name of the city    [/i]
