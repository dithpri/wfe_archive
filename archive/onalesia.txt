Welcome to Onalesia! We are a newly-founded region that dates back to as far as the 6th century, when the Onalula tribe settled on the banks of the Wolander river in south Ymrsia, so our region has a massive history. We expanded to the then whole Ymrgesque empire, which is now just Ymrsia and the surrounding states. We welcome kindly any nation that would respect our values. We stand for progressiveness and we are liberal and democratic. Thank you for visiting our page and learning about our history!
