A galactic confederation of worlds inhabited by humans. 

The Ekumen is made up of several dozen planets that were populated millions of years ago by humans from the planet Hain. The hainites used genetic engineering techniques to adapt humans to the conditions prevailing in each world. 

The stories of the Ekumen narrate the resurgence of interstellar travel at relativistic speeds , by which it takes years to go from one star to another (but only weeks or months from the point of view of the traveler, due to the dilation of time ), from the instantaneous communication through the same distances through the &quot;ansible&quot;  , and the efforts to reestablish a civilization on a galactic scale.
