The Ekumen is a direct democracy, in which all issues are voted upon by the member states of the region. There are a small set of immutable Social Axioms which dictate the democratic process, but besides that, all Social Standards are voted upon. The Ekumen welcomes all regions willing to participate peacefully in the experiment of direct democracy, assuming their ideologies conform to the Social Standards of the region.
