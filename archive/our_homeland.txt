[i]What is Our Homeland?[/i]

If you&#39;re passing by and see Our Homeland, you may wonder what it is - To put it simply, Our Homeland is a roleplaying region set in the greater NSWorld, primarily used as a puppet storage region by [nation]Kustgebied[/nation], though you&#39;ll find nations that aren&#39;t puppets of [nation]Kustgebied[/nation] in Our Homeland too. The name of Our Homeland comes from &#39;Ons Heemecht&#39;, the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZuozNHArQ0]Luxembourgish anthem[/url] (or, for those of you who want a different version, [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fp6CsaDcFI]here&#39;s the Derovolk version[/url]).

Our Homeland doesn&#39;t have a map or anything like that.

If you want to roleplay, telegram [nation]Kustgebied[/nation]. Same for showing off storefronts, etc. [nation]Kustgebied[/nation] likes being telegrammed.
