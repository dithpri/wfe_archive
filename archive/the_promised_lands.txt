The Promised Land is the land which, according to the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible), God promised and subsequently gave to Abraham and to his descendants. In modern contexts the phrase &quot;Promised Land&quot; expresses an image and idea related both to the restored Homeland for the Jewish people and to salvation and liberation. &#151;Wikipedia
