[b][color=blue]Lavinaria is a lost Earth colony that was settled approximately 10,000 years ago. Unfortunately, the colony failed and all advanced technology was destroyed. The stranded colonists founded the first primitive nations. Despite being a former colony, Lavinaria&amp;#39;s inhabitants are largely unaware of their true origin and dismiss any Earth Origin idea as pure fiction.[/color]
