[b][color=blue]Lavinaria is a lost Earth colony that was settled approximately 10,000 years ago. Unfortunately, the colony failed and the advanced technology that got the colonists to the planet was destroyed. The stranded colonists were scattered and founded the first primitive nations. Despite being a former Earth colony, Lavinaria&amp;#39;s inhabitants are largely unaware of their true origin and dismiss any Earth Origin idea as pure fiction.[/color]
