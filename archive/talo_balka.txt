We were on the hunt for Japanese schoolgirls as gift for [nation=short]Kraketopia[/nation]&#39;s Triumph ceremony but alas, [region]Japan[/region] is passworded so we thought we&#39;d look here. Since we&#39;ve come up empty-handed, we&#39;ll just have to keep looking.

Stop by [region]Europeia[/region]&#39;s [url=http://s6.zetaboards.com/Europeia/index]community forums[/url] to see what all the buzz is about.[/b]
