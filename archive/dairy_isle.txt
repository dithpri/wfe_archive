&amp;#129472;&amp;#127796; Welcome to the Dairy Isle! &amp;#127796;&amp;#129472;

Tucked away in the warm waves of the Milky Blue Sea, the Dairy Isle is a vibrant, sun-drenched region made up of scattered islands and a few hearty land masses. It&#146;s a place where the nations are *mostly* democratic, the people are friendly, and the culinary scene is absolutely udderly unmatched. Lactose Intolerance is met with capital punishment. The people? Lovely. The food? Legendary.

Currently overseen by the Great Ekkoran Empire, and proudly founded and formerly governed by the Republic of Diet Baja Blast.
