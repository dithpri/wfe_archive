I can&amp;#39;t find my left foot. It was next to my right one, but now it&amp;#39;s gone. I hobble around on one foot, and I can&amp;#39;t sit because of my hemorrhoids. Damn Commie children. I hate &amp;#39;em &amp;#39;cause they don&amp;#39;t know how to cut hair, push a plow, or beat women senseless when they&amp;#39;re drunk. I think God lives in my television.
