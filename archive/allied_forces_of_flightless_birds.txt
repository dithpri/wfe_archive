Hello! Be you a flightless bird? Whether or not you are a [color=brown]dodo[/color], an [color=purple]ostrich[/color], a [color=blue]penguin[/color], a [color=green]kiwi[/color], or none of the above, you are welcome to join our region.

[b][color=lime]WE ARE CURRENTLY RECRUITING. FEEL FREE TO JOIN UNLESS YOU ARE A RAIDER[/b][/color]

We have, up to this point, survived [b]1[/b] raid by the black riders. They&amp;#39;re no match for the power of [b][color=yellow]flightless birds[/color][/b]!

(I apologize for the garish colour scheme.)
