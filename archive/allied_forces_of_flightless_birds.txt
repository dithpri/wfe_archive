I don&amp;#39;t care what kind of bird you are, if you enjoy flying, then get in this region. We have fun bird activities, such as flying around in circles and screeching. For the flightless birds, we have distance marathons. Any flying creature is welcome. Even dragons.

[i]Any and all dragons please try not to [color=red]burn[/color] the region down while I&amp;#39;m away. Thanks.[/i]
