Graznavia is the old name of the lands concentrated around Tomania and mainly its south-eastern part. Most of the Graznavia people&#39;s political ideals are right-wing liberalism.
The Graznavians definitely know how to defend themselves and their motherland. Their combined armed forces, the GNDF, are well-equipped and prepared to repel all advances.
Glory to the Graznavia!
