This is a project I started recently in which exactly 1,061 planets in one solar system have regular continents as well as floating continents that are literally in the god damn sky, instead of regular humans, the solar system is inhabited by trillions of stickmen, and with dozens of people and dozens of planets come dozens of nations, one such nation is Kerham, which is the nation which founded the PA region in NationStates.
