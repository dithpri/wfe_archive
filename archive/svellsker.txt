    Situated on the outer rim of the Milky Way galaxy, the Valdyrstjarna system was discovered by Llamayan scientists as they looked for a place to settle once they escaped their stricken homeland of what was once [region]Further East Asia[/region]. Icy, remote, hostile, and harbouring unusually large amounts of radioactive mineral deposits, this spot was chosen as the future site of [nation]Llamaya[/nation] for its remote location, which would prevent Llamaya from attracting too much attention from the many antagonizing forces spread throughout the universe.
    Settling on the frozen inner planet of [region]Svellsker[/region], [nation]Llamaya[/nation] consolidates its existence, preparing for the moment when [region]Svellsker[/region] inevitably catches the eye of looming spacefaring threats.
