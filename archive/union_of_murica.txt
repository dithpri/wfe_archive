People have always aspired for freedom, its human nature, but we also crave order and safety however this has cost our freedom and our way of life. is this the only way? no we must as a nation have the greatest rights established that aren&#39;t ruined by cancel culture, snowflakes and radical nuts. we must remember what made Murica great and well that is you and your rights. God dam yeah.
