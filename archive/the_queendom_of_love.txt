[b]WELCOME TO THE QUEENDOM OF LOVE![/b]

The gynocentric region &amp;quot;[region]Queendom of Love[/region]&amp;quot; was originally founded by &amp;quot;[nation]Rule of Love[/nation]&amp;quot; in February, 2014, but she ceased to exist less than two months later, and the region was threatened by anti-woman forces.

No problem. [b][region]Femdom Empire[/region][/b] to the rescue, because that&#146;s what We do &#150; make fellow gynocentric regions safe from misogynistic abuse.

[region]Queendom of Love[/region] was refounded in June, 2014. We founded this similarly-named region to prevent its capture. Currently closed due to lack of interest. However, [b]if you would like to join or if you have any questions, please telegram [nation]Femdom Empire[/nation][/b].

Praise Sisterhood, and Femmepower.
