[color=green]The[/color] [region]Alliance Against Nazis[/region] Info Page:

In response to the acknowledged but shameful victory of the GGR in The Alliance Against Nazis (it took them an astonishing long time and support by their enemies to do so), the new region is the official continuation of the old region for others to fall back on, abandoning the old carcase to the genocidal Nazis. All previous members are encouraged to come here and continue the region&amp;#39;s legacy. An old chapter ends, another begins. 

Succesor region founded by [nation]Monganda[/nation], onetime member of the original region via a now deceased nation. Though a member of the [region]USSR[/region], [color=green]The[/color] [region]Alliance Against Nazis[/region] will remain fully sovereign.
