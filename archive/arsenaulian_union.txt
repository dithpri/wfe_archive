An intergovernmental union of nations on the continent of Arsenaulia founded and chaired by the Holy Empire of High Florinia. This is a roleplay region in an evolving fantasy universe set in Arsenaulia, an expansive frontier continent and a highly stylized fictional version of 1700s-1800s North America.

If you have the time then by all means come join and build the universe further! There aren&#39;t any strict rules regarding who can or can&#39;t join but it would certainly be preferable for incoming countries to have the right feel to them (if you have any questions please send High Florinia a message).
