Hey! This is a new region! As soon as we get some nations in here, we will elect a WA Delegate. All nations will be able to have freedom of speech and will have democratic elections! A [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=859471]Map[/url] has been established, contact the Vice Delegate to apply for a map place.  Also, endorse [nation]Cali-fornia[/nation]!!
There are no puppet nations allowed into this region, and you cannot place puppet nations on the map. Puppet nations found in this region will be banned from this region. 
If any of y&#39;all have questions, send a telegram to the [nation]Cali-fornia[/nation] or send one to [nation]New Camelot of Avalonia[/nation].
