Welcome to Akara! This is a peaceful region where roleplay is allowed!

There are only a few rules:
No bullying (e.g. You suck [nation name])
No slandering (e.g. [nation/region name] killed a person once)
No cuss words (e.g. [slur] you [nation/region])

There are no requirements! We don&#39;t care if you are level 3 or level 19, or have below-average civil right or extensive civil right! You can join as long as you don&#39;t break any rules.

Double and triple posting is allowed, as long as you don&#39;t spam the chat.
Roleplay is allowed, nothing pg-13 or pg-13+.
Don&#39;t bully people because they like things you don&#39;t (e.g. &#39;Anime sucks you stupid weeb&#39; should not be said here&#39;.)

It might also be fun to talk about other games!

Have fun!
