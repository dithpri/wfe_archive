The Archon Hierarchy was founded to maintain order across the Crux Sector of the Milky Way. Located in between several sectors that desire to clash over differing societies, virtues, and cultures, all while battling over the high-yielding sector of Crux. The Crux Sector is full of nations that have potential, the smaller nations are seemingly stronger than the larger ones, and all are individually different.
The Archon Hierarchy is also caught between the lawless Thanatos Sector and the corrupt corporates of Capitalist Space, the Hierarchy are few in number, but are just as powerful as the surrounding sectors individually.
