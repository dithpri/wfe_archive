The Commonwealth of Anglo Dominions is an alliance of Anglophone nations of British heritage that share the common values of traditionalism, conservatism, Christianity, and loyalty to the British Crown. The Commonwealth respects the independence of its constituent nations, as it serves as a means of projecting the voices of its members without infringing on their sovereign rights.
