[b]The Roleplay is one of the only active roleplay regions left in NationStates.[/b] Its mission is, no matter how strongly NS declined in activity over the years, to still be able to provide a region of active roleplayers. One day NS will rise once again out of the ashes of its glorious past.

[b]This is a mixed region,[/b] meaning that RP and Casual interaction happen on both the [b]NationStates webpage[/b] of the region [b]as well as the Discord[/b] of the region.
