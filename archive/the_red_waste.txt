The Red Waste is a forbidding landscape of stunted trees, devil grass and ancient ruins, which stretches for hundreds of miles south of the Dothraki Sea and Lhazar, the land of the Lhazareen. East of slaver cities and their hinterlands and north of the fabled city of Qarth. 

Within the Red Waste are three abandoned cities, Vaes Tolorro, and two others smaller located to the southwest. One of those is ringed with skulls on iron spears. To the south of Vaes Tolorro the waste continues to the sea. To the southeast lies Qarth.
