The Red Waste is a region on the continent of Essos. A forbidding landscape of stunted trees, devil grass and ancient ruins, which stretches southwards for hundreds of miles. It is a land of low hills, barren windswept plains, dry rivers and red parched soil. Where the necessities of living are hard to come by. There are few things in the Red Waste that will support life. There is little forage and shallow, bitter, stagnant pools of water. Wood is hard to find, with the best being gnarled and tough.

Within the Red Waste are three abandoned cities, Vaes Tolorro, and two smaller cities to its southwest. One of those is ringed with skulls on iron spears. To the south of Vaes Tolorro the waste continues to the sea. To the southeast lies Qarth.
