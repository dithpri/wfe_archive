The Central Europiab is a part of the continent, Europiab, containing four sections including West Europiab, East Europiab, and the Turkish Isles. Mainly temperate and alpine regions, but some are deserts and the Turkish Isles are mostly tropical rainforests and temperate. There&#146;s many other biomes (Tundra=East and Savanna=West) to this continent, but it&#146;s mostly forests, mountains, and dry oasis. Better for the greater good of prosperity.
