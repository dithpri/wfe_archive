Welcome to the [b]Bear Cave[/b]. Founded in 2016 by [nation]Ursa Arktos[/nation].

Just a simple place for those who love bears (the animal). This region is joined together as nations who wish to live the quiet life, supporting our agriculture industries and environments. We support peaceful resolutions to problems, and encourage harmony with other regions.
