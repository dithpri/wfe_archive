From the heart of Mainistan rises MECON, the unbreakable command of workers, soldiers, and comrades united under one banner. Forged in the furnaces of industry and bound by the will of the people, MECON drives the march toward a world free from exploitation. It is not merely an alliance &#151; it is the steel backbone of the socialist future, where every factory, every field, and every rifle stands in service to collective progress. Under Mainistan&#146;s leadership, MECON builds a new order of strength, equality, and destiny &#151; where the red star shines brightest and the revolution never sleeps.
