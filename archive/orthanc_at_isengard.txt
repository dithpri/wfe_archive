On April 28, 2016, Orthanc at Isengard was founded with the intention of being a place for nations that want a small, fast-paced, and rewarding region.  Long-time residents are well-rewarded with positions as officers.  Regular citizens are even able to gain higher influence, due to our smaller size.  We place high emphasis on embassies, as they allow greater influence.  Thus, we have a tendency to request many embassies all the time.  You can get in on the funk, too, if only you&#39;ll join our region, Orthanc at Isengard.
