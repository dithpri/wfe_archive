On April 28, 2016, Orthanc at Isengard was founded by [nation]old hampshireville[/nation] with the intention of being a place for nations that want a small, fast-paced, and rewarding region. We pride our region on being quite varied on its nations&#39; backgrounds. New recruits are highly appreciated, as they greatly increase this variety. However, we also take great joy in the establishment of new embassies. [color=blue][b]If you are considering joining, World Assembly membership is recommended, although not required.[/b][/color]
