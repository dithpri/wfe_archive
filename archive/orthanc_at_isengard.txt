On April 28, 2016, [color=green]Orthanc at Isengard[/color] was founded with the intention of being a place for nations that want a small, fast-paced, and rewarding region.  We pride our region on being quite varied on its nations&#39; backgrounds.  New recruits are highly appreciated, as they greatly increase this variety.  However, we also take great joy in the establishment of new embassies.  If you are to consider joining, [color=blue][b]World Assembly membership is recommended, although not required[/b][/color].

Please, endorse our WA Delegate, [nation]The Free Human Republic[/nation], as well as our humble founder, [nation]Old Hampshireville[/nation].  For that matter, please endorse all of our officers in the WA.

Best regards, Government of [color=green]Orthanc at Isengard[/color]
