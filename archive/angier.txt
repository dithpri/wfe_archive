[i][color=lightgreen]Welcome To Angier NC, Home Of The Crepe Myrtles![/color][/i]


[color=lightgreen]Historically known for tobacco farming and agricultural fairs, Angier has preserved its rural character while adapting to modern economic shifts.[/color]

[i][color=green]In fields where crepe myrtles sway and bloom,
Beneath a sky of soft sunlit plume,
Lies Angier, quiet and proud and sweet,
Where every stranger finds a seat.

The town may seem a humble name,
But in her roots burns steady flame&#151;
Of farmers&#146; hands and builders&#146; dreams,
Of Sunday bells and Law,

So here&#146;s to Angier, bold and kind,
With Southern soul and forward mind&#151;
A little town with room to grow,
Where past and future gently flow.[/color][/i]
