Welcome to the Homeworld of the Wolvens, a fierce and artistic species. Our planet consists of many deciduous forests, coniferous and tropical rain-forests. Mountain ranges are commonly over 30,000 Ft, (9,000m). Wolven Ore is also a common resource around here too. So basically, well, Alaska on Steroids.
