[b][color=purple]Oscar Romero[/color][/b] was a Catholic priest in El Salvador. He eventually grew sympathetic to the social justice movement in that country, which the hierarchy associated with liberation theology and generally frowned upon. His leadership in speaking out for the Salvadorian poor and the oppressed of the world led to his murder by government-backed right-wing militias.

&#147;The violence we preach is not the violence of the sword, the violence of hatred. It is the violence of love, of brotherhood,the violence that wills to beat weapons into sickles for work.&#148;
