[b][i][color=red]IL CREDO DEL FASCISTA E L&#39;EROISMO, QUELLO DEL BORGHESE L&#39;EGOISMO[/b][/color][/i]

[color=blue][b]&#147;Two ideas are opposed &#151; not concepts or abstractions, but Ideas which were in the blood of men before they were formulated by the minds of men. The Resurgence of Authority stands opposed to the Rule of Money; Order to Social Chaos, Hierarchy to Equality, socio-economic-political Stability to constant Flux; glad assumption of Duties to whining for Rights; Socialism to Capitalism, ethically, economically, politically; the Rebirth of Religion to Materialism; Fertility to Sterility; the spirit of Heroism to the spirit of Trade; the principle of Responsibility to Parliamentarism.&quot;[/b][/color]
