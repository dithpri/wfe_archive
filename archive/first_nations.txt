[color=blue][b]&#147;The Resurgence of authority stands opposed to the rule of money; order to social chaos, hierarchy to equality, socio-economic-political stability to constant flux; glad assumption of duties to whining for rights; socialism to capitalism, ethically, economically, politically; the rebirth of religion to materialism; fertility to sterility; the spirit of heroism to the spirit of trade; the principle of responsibility to parliamentarism.&quot;[/b][/color]
