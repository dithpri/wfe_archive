Contact [nation]Andropoland[/nation] when you finally realized that the region in which your Monarchial power lies was deleted upon the former founder&amp;#39;s cessation to exist, and it was so valiantly saved *Cough* stolen *Cough* by the very person who sought to destroy it.

Just kidding. TG me with your main nation and I&amp;#39;ll let you refound it yourself eventually. ^_^

In Solidarity,
