The Confederate States of Eurasia is an alliance of anti-communist, anti-fascist countries in Eurasia. Founded by the Federation of South Navarro on 4/29/21. The flag of the Confederate States of Eurasia is based off the flag of the former National Federation of Texas &amp; Navarro, before it was shattered by civil war, following the NFTN&#39;s adoption of Facism. The evil remnants of the NFTN are still at war with the Confederate States of Eurasia.
