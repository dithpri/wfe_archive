WE ALL COME FROM THE SAME LIGHT
We are a community-based organization and aimed to protect the intellectual freedoms of all people of free will.

Together, we honor all faces and forms of Lucifer, the Light-Bearer, and explore the historical and cultural significance of Venusian energy and worship. Our understanding of Lucifer predates the Abrahamic religions, drawing from ancient traditions, rites, and practices of God/Goddess reverence. We host both public and private gatherings

To us, Lucifer is a current of energy - As we uplift ourselves, we uplift the world around us.
