The [b][region]Far Side of the Moon[/region][/b], often mistakenly referred as [i]the Dark Side of the Moon[/i], is the side of the moon that always faces away from the Earth due to tidal locking.

In the not so far future, the Far Side of the Moon will become an important hub of the Solay System, serving planets within and beyond Asteroid Belt.
