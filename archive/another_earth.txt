[b]Welcome to [region]Another Earth[/region]!  We&amp;#39;re a region of laid back, RP dedicated nations who banded together to create a region based around an alternate history earth. We operate as an MT, mostly human only region, and are always looking for new members to join in for some fun RPs! We operate with a limited regional government, but with enough freedom that nations can rise and form their own factions and coalitions.[/b]
