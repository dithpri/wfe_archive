Ideally, nations of The United Super Socialist Region (U.S.S.R.) believe society shares all property in common, everyone shares the burden of labor, and everyone shares the profits of that labor. They believe the needs of their respective nations, and of the region, are far more important than those of international interest. However, they have a healthy respect for diplomacy, and a keen interest in peace-keeping efforts.

We value your diversity and culture. We value your freedom to do as you wish with the power you have, so long as its damages affect none but yourself. You have the freedom to choose.
