We are the Holy Crusaders, who will crusade this world and rid it from the unholy filth that plague it. Divided between two faiths, the old and the new, the internal politics are very complicated. We do agree on one thing though, that the timing for a new crusade is upon us. Those who join will have that at the core of their principles, without religion a nation is nothing. We strive to make other nations, something.
