Mesopotamia (from the Greek, meaning &amp;#39;between two rivers&#146;) is an ancient region in the eastern Mediterranean bounded in the northeast by the Zagros Mountains and in the southeast by the Arabian Plateau, corresponding to today&#146;s Iraq, mostly, but also parts of modern-day Iran, Syria and Turkey. The &amp;#39;two rivers&amp;#39; of the name referred to the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers and the land was known as &amp;#39;Al-Jazirah &amp;#39;(the island) by the Arabs referencing what Egyptologist J.H. Breasted would later call the Fertile Crescent, where Mesopotamian civilization began.
