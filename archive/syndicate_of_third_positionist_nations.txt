[b]Reject the false dichotomy, embrace a third position![/b]

The Syndicate of Third Positionist Nations is a new organization believing simply that we must reject the modern day ideas of capitalism, communism, democracy, and libertarianism. We strive for national identity in our homelands, to have a realm of order. We believe in a unification of our country&#39;s people. Those who follow this example include but aren&#39;t limited to fascists, strasserists, national bolshevists, and national syndicalists. This will be a region of collaboration, discussion, and finding those with similar minds of ours.

If you fit these beliefs, you are welcome to message [nation]Vyrnetrya[/nation] to request a seat in this new region.
