The Syndicate of Third Positionist Nations is a new organization believing simply that we must reject the modern day ideas of capitalism, communism, democracy, and libertarianism. We strive for nationalism in our homelands, to have a realm of order. Those who follow this example include but aren&#39;t limited to fascists, strasserists, national bolshevists, and national syndicalists. This will be a region of collaboration, discussion, and finding those with similar minds of ours.
