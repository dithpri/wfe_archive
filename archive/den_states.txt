  The Den States are based around Mid Devon. They include the great Den Cultures of:
The Mohawks
The Raiders
Avranches
Barnfield
The Plantation Dens
Westernlea
and the Chav Dens.
  These small states vie for supremacy in an area now controlled mostly by DEONQED and its vassals. Once the area was dominated by NED and its allies, who had 50 members between them, but NED has since collapsed. Now there are few people left in the Den World, and DEONQED it what remains of the old order.
