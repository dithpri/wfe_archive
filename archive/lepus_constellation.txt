[i]Lepus is a constellation lying just south of the celestial equator. Its name is Latin for hare. It is located below&#151;immediately south&#151;of Orion (the hunter), and is sometimes represented as a hare being chased by Orion or by Orion&#39;s hunting dogs. Although the hare does not represent any particular figure in Greek mythology, Lepus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations.[/i][b]Founded by the andarian starfleet on: 04/05/2025.[/b]
