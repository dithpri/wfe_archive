[i]&amp;quot;The Vile Nations may rebuke or persecute you along the Journey To Better Places. You may search for Days, Weeks, Months, Years...and still find no Shelter from the Cruelty Of Our World, no Reprieve from the Slaver&amp;#39;s Whip or the Pillager&amp;#39;s Blade. But that which emerged Nord Yervhenn - the Confederacy - will take you under its Sheltering Wings Of Protectorship. With your Freedom attained, and your Enemies struck down by the Mighty Rifle Of Freedom, the Love Of Brotherhood &amp;amp; Universal Justice shall follow forevermore...&amp;quot;[/i]
