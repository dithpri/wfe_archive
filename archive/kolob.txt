Kolob is an Earth-like exoplanet orbiting a star about 20 light years away from Earth. As Earth began colonising different solar systems from its own, the Earthean Empire grew very vast very quickly, but even so relatively small given the scale of our galaxy. This planet, originally called &quot;IO2810&quot;, was renamed to Kolob after a group of isolationists went away from Earth&#39;s colonising path to settle in this far away body. Absolutely and intentionally cut off from Earth and humanity as a whole, Kolob became a place for humans who didn&#39;t like the way Earth does things to start again.
