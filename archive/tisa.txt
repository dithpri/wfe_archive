The Inheritors of the Stars Alliance is a world alliance of Neo Terra.

Neo Terra was founded following a mission to the stars around 2500 AD. The entire fleet, holding twenty million people, simultaneously were dropped out of transit near Neo Terra. All sub-light drives were sabotaged by unknown forces, and the crew aboard &amp;quot;The Karabela&amp;#39;s Cry,&amp;quot; the flagship of the fleet, signaled the rest of the ships to find an inhabitable world to make their base until they can return home.
