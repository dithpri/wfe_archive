&quot;[i]The sun rises in the East. 

Across our land, men and women go to work, in factories and farms, providing for their families. 
Everyone has a job, everyone knows the part they play; keeping our country strong, and safe
So today, we give thanks to our brave leaders, knowing we are stronger and prouder and better

Yes, It&#39;s A New Day in our proud land, but our greatest days, they lie ahead. Sieg Heil[/i]&quot;
