[b][color=#000080]National Socialism is in essence the family structure applied to a nation state and its government.
 
Whereas a family is strongly bound by blood, home, and love, a National Socialist state as an extension of the family model is bound by race, nation, and national patriotism. Citizen nations of [region]National Socialist America[/region] will have the freedom and liberty to do as they will, as long as it is not detrimental to any other citizen nation and in the best interest of our regions at all times.
