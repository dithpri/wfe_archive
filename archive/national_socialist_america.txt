[i][b]&quot;A man is only ever as strong as the people around him. The community he serves and the family he is sworn to protect. Whatever strength he has, he draws from them. And for them, he must be prepared to give up everything. His life, his blood, or else everything he has done has been for nothing. He is nothing.&#148;[/i][/b] ~ John Smith
