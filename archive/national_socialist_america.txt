[i]National Socialism is best viewed as the family structure applied to government. The family is connected by blood, soil, and love. Similarly, a National Socialist state is connected by race, territory, and by national patriotism. 

In [region]National Socialist America[/region], one has natural rights and a proportionate amount of earned responsibilities. Citizen nations have the freedom and liberty to do as they will, as long as it is not at the detriment of any other citizen nation or the region itself and are encouraged to defend our world view in regional combat.
