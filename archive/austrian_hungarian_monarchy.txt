The Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy (German: [i]&Ouml;sterreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie[/i]; Hungarian: [i]Osztr&aacute;k&#150;Magyar Monarchia[/i]) is the legal name of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which, after 1867, became the union of the many Kingdoms, Duchies, and other feudal states that were held by the House of Habsburg-Lorraine after the Napoleonic Wars.
