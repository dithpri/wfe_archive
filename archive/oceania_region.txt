[b]Hello and Welcome, to Oceania Region![/b]
Just a reminder that, in Oceania, you can do pretty much whatever you want (just be friendly and respectful).

Check out some of our awesome dispatches, like the Region Heritage List, where you can have your own nations structures featured for the world to admire! Now, head to the RMB and say Hi!

A warm welcome,
