- Once the teams are in position, the Delegate will be given Executive and Border Control authority.  To keep the region safe from unwanted guests, I&#39;ll be password protecting the region before hand.

- The defence team is not allowed to ban the invading nations, only to kick them.  However, once a nation is kicked they&#39;re not allowed back in for an hour.

- Whichever team holds the Delegacy by the end of the 24 hour period, wins.  After that, I&#39;ll be shutting down the Delegacy again.
