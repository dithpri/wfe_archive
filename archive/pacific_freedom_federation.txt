The Pacific Freedom Federation (PFF) is a coalition of sovereign nations dedicated to upholding the principles of democracy, individual liberty, and rule of law across the Pacific region. Established to foster cooperation, mutual defense, and economic partnership, PFF stands as a bulwark against authoritarianism and promotes freedom both at home and abroad.

Spanning the vast and diverse Pacific Rim, PFF members encompass coastal and island nations stretching from East Asia through Oceania to the western shores of the Americas. The federation benefits from a strategic maritime position and rich cultural diversity.
