The United Planetary Sovereignty, abbreviated as UPS and usually referred to as &quot;the Federation&quot;, is a interstellar federal republic composed of planetary sovereignty. The planetary governments agree to exist semi-autonomously under a single central authority based on the Utopian principles of universal liberty, rights, and equality, and to share their knowledge and resources in peaceful cooperation and space exploration; each member world retains its own political and social structure, with the Federation itself serving as a &#39;United Nations&#39;-type advisory body.
