[b]Welcome to the [color=darkred]Yorktown Aristocracy[/color]![/b]
[hr]

[color=grey]This region was established on the belief that any nation, aligned with our democratic and pro-capitalist views, has unfettered access across the Aristocracy. 

Though the Y.A. is a region primarily proposing peace throughout the world, defensive measures will be swiftly taken when deemed necessary.  

Once voted upon, WA members of the region [i]MUST[/i] endorse the Delegate of the Aristocracy. Currently [nation=great leeston]

[i]Let them hate, so long as they fear.[/i][/color]
