[color=red][b][u]Welcome to the ACA! [i](Allied Cool Association)[/i][/u][/b][/color]

This region has been many things over the years. Before we came back, it was a ghost town.

[i][b]But now we&#39;re back[/b][/i]. All are welcome, all will be treated with [color=green][b]respect[/b][/color]. We&#39;re here to have a good time. Whatever you define as a good time, you may do so freely here. Regional government, invading/defending, or casual conversation can all be apart of this region. Form up in cliques, parties, whatever you so please. Just make sure to [b]enjoy[/b]!
