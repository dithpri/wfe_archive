[b]Welcome to the ACA[/b]

Welcome to one of the most politically insignificant but historic regions in the game [color=red](as long as you have a [i]flexible[/i] definition of historic)[/color].

This is not the first, nor is it likely to be the last time this region has been revived, [b][i]but hey[/i][/b]. Now we are operating without our Founder, [nation]Titanshen[/nation] and will need to make hard decisions about where to take this region.

[b]YOU[/b] can make a difference here. It&#39;s a clean slate in a region with some sort of notoriety, so try and revive the region from the ashes.
