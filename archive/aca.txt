[color=blue][b]Welcome to the ACA[/b]! We&amp;#39;re here to provide you a home, a place for you to feel safe. A place for you to thrive and have your thoughts and ideas be heard. A place where you will be recognized as a member. A place where you are treated as an actual human being and not just another nation to add to their count. We have several things to offer pretty much, every nation. Debates will be held on the RMB. We have forums and we are forming a government. We hold regular polls to see what everyone is feeling.[b][/color]
