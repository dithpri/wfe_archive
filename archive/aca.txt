[b][color=Blue]The Allied Capitalist Association[/color][/b]

The ACA is an [i]illustrious[/i] region, just ripe with potential. We&amp;#39;ve fought in wars, we&amp;#39;ve brokered peace between regions, and we&amp;#39;ve asserted ourselves as the name for capitalism, at a time far, far away from today.. We are no longer our, glorious, large and independent former selves; for we have been plagued by a terrible and gruesome disease, that can infect and kill any region outside of the feeders and sinkers.. Inactivity.

We&amp;#39;re looking for [B][color=green]capitalists[/color][/B]. We&amp;#39;re looking for [color=blue][B]libertarians[/B][/color]. We&amp;#39;re looking for [B][color=red]anarchists[/color][/B]. We&amp;#39;re looking for individuals who support free people, and free markets. 

We&amp;#39;re looking for [B]you[/B].
