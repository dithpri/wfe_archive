[b][color=#0000ff]The [region]Europeia[/region]n Republic Navy set sail tonight with a new flag ship leading the armada, Lieutenant [nation]Istillian[/nation] captaining the ship.
Ist tried out pointing for the first time and did great work, allowing us to claim this region and some others.[/color]
