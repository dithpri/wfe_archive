[color=#f5f6f0]There&#39;s [i]literally[/i] nothing to see here. What was once no region is still no region.

This isn&#39;t anything, really, and it wasn&#39;t anything before either. You know what I mean? 

There are plenty of actual regions, such as [b][region=Lone Wolves United][/b] and [b][region=Arda en Estel][/b]. But this one, this one is not a region.

It&#39;s a difficult thing, to describe nothing, especially something that is nothing. There are regions and then there are no regions, as in regions that don&#39;t exist - nothings.

You&#39;re currently looking at one of those nothings. [/color][b]94[/b][color=#f5f6f0] somethings have attempted to cross into this nothing, but were unsuccessful because, well, that&#39;s just silly.[/color]
