The Actongolian Empire is based on the planet of Actongol, far away from Earth. The empire decided to colonize and become a part of planet Earth, primarily to have a foothold and fallback area in the Earth&#39;s solar system in case of war gone wrong and to have an influence on Earthling politics so they do not turn against the empire. Earthling nations are welcome to become a part of the furry empire.
