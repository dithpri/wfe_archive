This is my final goodbye to the Literature Club.

I finally understand. The Literature club is truly a place where no happiness can be found. To the very end, it continued to expose innocent minds to a horrific reality - a reality that our world is not designed to comprehend. I can&#39;t let any of my friends undergo that same hellish epiphany.

For the time it lasted, I want to thank you. For making all of my dreams come true. For being a friend to all of the club members.

And most of all, thank you for being part of my Literature Club!
With everlasting love,
Monika
