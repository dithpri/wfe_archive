[/color][color=633517]
New Brunswick is one of Canada&#39;s three Maritime provinces, 
the only constitutionally bilingual province (French and English) in the country. 
The name comes from the archaic English name of Braunschweig, a city in northern Germany. 
The province today is strongly influenced by the Irvings and the McCains families.
