A safe heaven of Imperial democracy. We&amp;#39;re a nuclear force, have a strong military, navy, aviation and strategic units deployed at all times. We have laser beams, photon torpedoes and all kinds of SF weaponry at our disposal to obliterate our enemies to dust.
Imperial authority is over everything(supervising democratic process), but Parliament and Government takes care of day-to-day running of our glorious nation. Freedom of speech, of the press and assembly are sacred to us. There&amp;#39;s no death penalty, criminals are being exiled. Our Charter is law above all. Even Emperor, God-leader, is bound by it. The People has the power, not the State. Period.
