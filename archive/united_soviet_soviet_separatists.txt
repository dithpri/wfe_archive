Welcome to [b][color=green]United Soviet Soviet Separatists[/color][/b], a welcoming, diverse region mostly made up of those who have left the region [b][region]United Soviet Soviet Soviets[/region][/b] due to founder [nation]Bestburgia[/nation]&#39;s continued abuse of power. 

Here in USSSe, all systems of government are welcome, and [b][color=green]officer positions[/color] [color=orange]will be provided to anyone who asks[/color][/b]. If you believe that an executive is abusing their power, non-executive officers may vote to begin impeachment proceedings, and next, all region members will participate in a 2/3 majority vote to decide on the fate of said officer.

Come to USSSe, where everyone is equally heard, and everyone is equally welcomed.
