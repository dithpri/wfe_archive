Outside, the heat of the planet&#146;s dying sun has grown so great that to step outside for more than a few hours is a death sentence. Humanity now lives in massive metal Domes connected by underground tunnels. Solar panels lie on top of the Domes to collect energy that is used to grow food. Hunters wearing protective equipment are sent outside to forage for food and necessary materials. Each Dome essentially has its own government &#150; while several Domes may be united under one central authority, the governor of each Dome has almost total power.
