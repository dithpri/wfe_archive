[region]Strangerealistic[/region] was once a large region founded October 22nd, 2016 by [nation]Belkaa[/nation] with approximately 30 nations. Slowly the region has died out, leaving only a few remaining countries. Day by day the region gets closer to extinction; the only question left is who will be the last nation standing.
