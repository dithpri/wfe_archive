Yo

I am the one and only user that created a bunch of nations just to have fun around the regions. On my journeys, I was able to find very nice friends, and I was able to grow my RP a lot, though it still needs improving. So I am taking a nap from all the NS and just chatting and building some good lore. If you see below those are the dispatches I am going to write, in order of prioritization. But if you see that nothing has changed is because life is swallowing me :P
