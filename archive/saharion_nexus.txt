The Saharion Nexus is a vast expanse of interconnected desert realms, where each principality or city-state is situated around a unique oasis, forming a network of trade routes and alliances. The entire region is characterized by mystical sand dunes, ancient ruins buried beneath the shifting sands, and a shared reliance on the precious life-giving waters found in hidden oases.
