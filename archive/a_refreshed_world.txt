Welcome to ARW, where you may claim land, and RP as you like. We do not have our forums up yet, however, we are looking to publish it as soon as we can to this region. Soon, elections will be posted, and you will be able to vote for who you&#39;d like to win &#39;Officer&#39; Positions. The WA Delegate will be up as soon as possible, too.
