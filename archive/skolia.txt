The kingdoms, and empires of Skolia. Skolia is a grand, large, norse continent. Skolia is home to many civilizations, kingdoms, peoples and animals. Hundskol is the original, largest yet weakest of the kingdoms. Some kingdoms may arise and join Skolia, or not. Skolia is a tough land, home to tough people. Only the strongest of Dictatorships, Kingdoms, and Empires survive here. Democracy is no choice in Skolia. Welcome and thank you to all who may visit and join Skolia.
