Roleplay Active as of X/XX/2018[hr]The Remnant Stars is a sci-fi roleplay region centered around nations and characters alike. If you&#39;re looking for a place to finally jump into a functioning sci-fi RP that is free of all NS stats and has systems which are subject to change with the peoples input, this may be the place for you. Please be sure to read the documents inside of the Grand Archive, and don&#39;t be shy to speak to government officials. It is their job to help you, and to keep the region functional.[hr][url=https://discord.gg/GFzV5eu]Regional Discord[/url] | [url=AAA]Regional Map[/url] | [url=aaa]The Grand Archive of the Remnant Stars[/url]
