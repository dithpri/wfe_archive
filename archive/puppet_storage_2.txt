[b]The Vulcans landed on Earth after that Zefram Cochrane guy created warp! And we saw some pretty nifty robots, aren&#39;t I right? We in the [region]Crimson Crusaders[/region] and our [region]Astoria[/region]n Allies, or the [i]Starfleet Department of War[/i] as they&#39;re calling it, decided to host a celebration here! We played all the rock &#39;n&#39; roll jams we could, ate some pierogi, and had a galactic time![hr][/b][i]Want to have your fun galactic parties yourself?
