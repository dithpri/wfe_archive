[color=purple]On dark of night the assassins&#39; blows silent 30 times not-3. Let the left-hand know not what the right-hand does, lest no one go beyond that which is good. Another time, another place, another being out of space, ever-correcting, ever-wandering, yet the stars&#39; and the moon&#39;s sparkling shine ever in the darkness. 

Yet all blades of Damascus and stainless steel catch the light of the moon, and when caught, it gives itself away. Distraught, it loses focus. 

But where there is light, there is also darkness. And where there is darkness, there will always be malice.
