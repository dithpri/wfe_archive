We are a diverse region, home to many member states of different political ideologies. We are founded on the tenants of tolerance, and strive to create a more perfect union, where nations are not judged on the type of government they hold, but the good that they do. We do not, however, tolerate irreverence. We welcome you to City Skylines 2, where all strive to create equality and uphold the rule of law.

We have two terrorist nations.
