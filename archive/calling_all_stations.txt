This is the designated headquarters region of the UIAN (united interstellar alliance of nations). If you would like to meet aliens, join an interstellar alliance inspired by the Star Trek Federation, or are a fan of the band Genesis (which this region was named in honor of) then you have come to the right place. Even if you don&#39;t want to join the UIAN or have nothing to contribute to the UIAN, then you are still welcome to settle here in the region, and we will not turn anyone away unless the region gets full, or you pose a significant enough threat to the UIAN to where it would be better for you to leave. At any rate, please enjoy your stay in this humble region.
