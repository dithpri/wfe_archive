We seem to have been invaded and somehow Aitheria is gone (stopped playing?).  I now have access to admin panel, which I did not have before.  For now there is a password, which you can get by requesting it.  



I would like input from everyone (especially the founding members).  What do you know about Aitheria and in either case how would you like to move forward from this?  

I don&amp;#39;t have the original flag file, so this is a placeholder.  Let me know if anyone has the original or if you guys want something else.   




Thanks.
