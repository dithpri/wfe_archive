Kalimdor (Titan and Darnassian for land of eternal starlight) is one of the main continents of Azeroth. It is located to the west of the Eastern Kingdoms, southwest of Northrend and northwest of Pandaria. The Great Sea lies in between the continents. Kalimdor is home to the night elves, orcs, tauren, trolls, and draenei. Other races present include the ogres, centaur, naga, demons, and other, more minor races.
Kalimdor can be further divided into three major regions known as North Kalimdor, Central Kalimdor, and South Kalimdor.
