The Kingdom of Empires is one of the world&#39;s youngest regions, but its influence is already starting to spread to older nations. The Kingdom of Empires accepts all travelers and nations, whether you are a dictatorship, a democracy, or any other type of nation.
     Here in this region, members participate in polls (which later can be voted on by the World Assembly if there is enough of a driving force behind it) games, and challenges, and chat with other members.
