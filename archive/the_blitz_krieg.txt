Here&amp;#39;s come the mirror man!
says he&amp;#39;s a people fan!
Here&amp;#39;s come the mirror man,
and the man at the back said everyone attack,
and they called it the Ballroom Blitz,
the Ballroom Blitz.
I see a little silhoutto of a man,
Scaramouche, scaramouche will you do the fandango,
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me!
You don&amp;#39;t have to be a weather man to know which way the wind blows.

- The Human League, Misfits, Queen and Bob Dylan
