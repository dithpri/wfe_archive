Argantia.

Standing like a fortress in the North of the world, Argantia is an old continent, of proud nations. Yet it is not without its problems. The great nations are at near constant odds, and many years of historical strife are hard to put aside. Despite this, the continent remains strong.

There have been attempts to further the region in terms of political unity. The Argantian Continental Council has been recently set up, and soon plans to set laws and act as a presiding body. The continent stands at a turning point. With a bit of co-operation, (and a bit of luck) the old problems between the Argantian nations may be soothed.

Also, we&amp;#39;ve been the 666th largest region on NS. Argantia - home of Satan since 2013.
