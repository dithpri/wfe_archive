Argantia.

Standing like a fortress in the North of the world, Argantia is an old continent, of strong, proud nations. Yet it is not without its problems. The great nations are at near constant odds, and many years of historical strife are hard to put aside. Despite these problems, the continent is strong.

There have been attempts, recently, to further the region in terms of political unity. The Argantian Continental Council will be set up, and soon plans to set laws and act as a presiding body. The continent stands at a turning point. With a bit of co-operation, (and a bit of luck) the old problems between the Argantian nations may be soothed.

Also, we&amp;#39;ve been the 666th largest region on NS. Argantia - home of the Beast since 2013.
