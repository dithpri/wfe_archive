Argantia stands somewhere in the north of the world. It has been inhabited for quite a long time and hopefully will remain so for a while longer. Unfortunately, the inhabitants of this fair land have rarely seen eye-to-eye and so Argantia has seen rather a lot of suspicion. There is a solution, thankfully; a new, unifying force - the Argantian Continental Council - has been set up and will bridge age old prejudices and forge a lasting peace. That&amp;#39;s the plan, at least, but who knows if things will work out nicely?

Also, we&amp;#39;ve been the 666th region on NS, making us a sort of holiday home for Satan or something.
