The Stremian Communion of Nations is a sacred imperial federation of sovereign realms, protectorates, colonies, and spiritual dominions bound together under the moral, liturgical, and dynastic authority of the Kingdom of Stremia. Formed after the Marian Restoration and consolidated in the 21st century, the Communion stands as a beacon of altar-rooted governance, monarchist unity, and religious-cultural renewal in a fractured age.

Each member-state retains autonomy in internal affairs but affirms spiritual and ceremonial allegiance to the Crown of Stremia and its sacred mission of civilizational renewal.
