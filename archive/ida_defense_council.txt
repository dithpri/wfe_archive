[color=blue]Here the members of the IDA (the Defense Council) will meet.  Each member region must send a representative.  The IDA is an alliance of regions dedicated to each other&amp;#39;s mutual defense.[/color]

The IDA is at this time a dormant organization. At some time in the future, it may be revived, but at the present, it is a dead organization.
