This region is the remnant of the antartic territories. We are one of the founding regions of the Confederacy of Roleplaying Nations (CORN). We welcome all players, whether casual or serious, to join us. Please be respectful and have fun. If your experience is ever dulled by the limitations of the game system, please contact me to become an active member of the roleplaying community. While not a full time expereince, this game has many features, and we hope that you can take full advantage of them here in this community.
