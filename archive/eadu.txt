A storm-stricken planet in the Outer Rim Territories. It hosted the Eadu Energy Conversion Laboratory prior to the outbreak of the Galactic Civil War, where Galen Erso and his team of scientists attempted to unlock the secrets of the kyber crystals as part of the Death Star project.

The refinery was targeted by agents of the Alliance to Restore the Republic following the destruction of Jedha City and resulted in the ruination of the facility and the death of Erso.
