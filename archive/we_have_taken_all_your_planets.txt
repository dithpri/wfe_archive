We&#39;ve taken all your planets in this admittedly insane version of reality. Feel free to join if you have the will-power to reign supreme across the cosmos!

Whtayp is a region controlled (iron-fistedly) by the Executive Branch; a shady cabal of administrators, bureaucrats and social workers. 

Our region inhabits a small and inconsiderable (as well as newly discovered) area of land in the far-off southern oceans of the world. We also sustain a massive advertisement campaign, looking to get people to inhabit the stars and control the Solar System! 

That is our ultimate destiny.
