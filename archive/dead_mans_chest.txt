Dead Man&#39;s Chest is a legendary treasure,
Possessing it offers a power beyond measure.
The pirate frantically examines the chest,
Before spotting a riddle that only few can best.
He reads the riddle to himself he thinks,
&quot;Every passing moment my survival chances shrinks.&quot;
Open the pinned dispatch and answer with haste,
For to save the pirate not a second should waste.
