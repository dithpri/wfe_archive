All women shall be servants to men.

We worship the Roman emperor God Trajan.

The all powerful Trajan commands women to hide out in their houses and to faithfully serve their husbands.

Every street has a shrine of Trajan where one must daily worship.

King Kristofersson never leaves the region and will stay with it forever no matter what happens.
