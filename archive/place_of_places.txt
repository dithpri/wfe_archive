&quot;The Place of Places&quot;, the name given to a form of limbo between existence and non-existence. Permanent residents are rare, as most nations quickly return to their own area of existence before proper contact with others in limbo can be established. Here, the rules of reality themselves are unstable, and the supernatural are common.
