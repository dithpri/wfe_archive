First discovered in the early 6th century, many of the islands are located in the Arctic Ocean extending from north Eurasia all the way to north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere. For much of European history, the Arctic islands remained largely unexplored and their geography conjectural up until the late 6th century, when the island now known as Exodus was first populated by humans. Now the region is home to 20+ Million people and is known for its oil, technology and military exports. The region has also been the center for brutal wars and conflicts, with many currently on-going.
