Los Barrios de los Pelados is a hodge-podge of nations that don&#39;t really get along with each other. They&#39;re all ruled under the same leader, whose constant changes in mental state disrupt the status quo of everything. Every resolution to issues are thus subsequently put into law, allowing the same issues to affect nations differently. While the citizenry hate each other, immigration between each is legal which means everybody is happy right where they belong.

You may address the supreme leader as Dick Mongus.
