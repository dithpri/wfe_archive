The Union of the Greater Nation (U.G.N.) has been founded by Fraztovia and &Ouml;sterria and officiated by the agreement of Sell-Am-See in August 1935 which were meant to make trade and travel much easier within these two nations. It&amp;#39;s later, in 1946 that the Tsardom of Courlande-Semigallia has officially joined the initiative.

Ideas such as freedom of movement, free market, social and technological collaboration as well as a strong military alliance between all the nations that are part of the U.G.N. are what its founders try to accomplish with much passion. Dialogue and diplomacy are values they tend to use as a priority over armed conflict. Calling to arms is used as a last resort.
