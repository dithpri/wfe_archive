As members of the Anatolian Islands, we strive to work together for the glory of our nations through the values of peace and friendship, which is done through the regions INAC (the International Nations Association Committee). Although small, we stand strong against anyone who dares to take control of our islands through the barbaric acts of violence and political corruption, for we are one great region that stands together for the glory of our future. May we strive with our glorious region through the years to come!
