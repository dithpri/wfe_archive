The Socialist Workers Union of Bengal (SWUB) unites districts of West Bengal and divisions of Bangladesh under socialism. Formed after 2024 political unrest and a civil conflict between socialist workers and the old regime, SWUB emerged victorious. The union of West Bengal&#146;s socialist districts with liberated Bangladeshi divisions was secured through struggle and negotiations emphasizing shared culture and workers&#146; solidarity.

Governed by democratic workers&#146; councils, SWUB prioritizes collective ownership, social welfare, and equality. It seeks to build a just socialist society that protects cultural diversity and fosters international solidarity, symbolizing worker unity and progress in Bengal.
