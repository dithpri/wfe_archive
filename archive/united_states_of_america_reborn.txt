A new amendment for the Constitution is currently being written.

Also note, the [b][i]Constitution of the United States of America Reborn[/b][/i] will say that it has recently been edited. And yes, it has, it was just a formatting error though, it was bugging me so I had to change it. No other part of the constitution was changed, just a tab that was out of place.
