Army gives power. No one respect the weak ones. Sooner or later, they become puppets. We are the hands, that noone see, we decide how they move. Every nation must be able to protect itself. Defence forces are meant to work outside of the borders, while the law enforcements work inside. Nationalism is the key. People must see their country as their priority. Every single one of us is important, has its role. Our nation is like a machine, if something is broken, or not working as supposed to, all of us feel it, know it. We either benefit, or lose. It is not a question of dedication, but awareness, that all of a sudden hard times may come, and sacrifice has to be made! Dont think of yourself as one, dont forget of your brothers, and sisters.
