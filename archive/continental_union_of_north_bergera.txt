[b]The Continental Union of North Bergera (CUNB)[/b]

[i]Founded by [nation]Doutsonyinoutarra[/nation] in 2019, the CUNB is intended to unite the nations of North Bergera and prevent large-scale conflict within the continent. There is technically only one currency, but each nation refers to it by a different name. Each nation in the region has a single representative, but the leader of the CUNB is traditionally Doutsonyinoutarran.[/i]
