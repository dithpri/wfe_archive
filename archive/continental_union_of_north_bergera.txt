[i]Founded by [nation]Doutsonyinoutarra[/nation] in 2019, the CUNB is intended to unite the nations of North Bergera and prevent large-scale conflict within the continent. There is technically only one currency, but each nation refers to it by a different name. Each nation in the region has a single representative, but the leader of the CUNB is traditionally the leader of Doutsonyinoutarra.[/i]
