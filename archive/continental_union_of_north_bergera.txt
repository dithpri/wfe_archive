[i]Founded by [nation]Doutsonyinoutarra[/nation] in 2019, the CUNB is intended to unite the nations of North Bergera and prevent large-scale conflict within the continent. There is technically only one currency, but each nation refers to it by a different name. Each nation in the region has a single representative, but the leader of the CUNB is traditionally the leader of Doutsonyinoutarra.[/i]

[i]Our regional lore as well as our rules will be kept in our Discord server.
Non-CUNB nations are allowed to join to check things out, but please don&#39;t raid us or be disrespectful.[/i]
