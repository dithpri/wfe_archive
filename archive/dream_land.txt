[color=#1E90FF]Dream Land is a country that features a wide array of both landscapes and inhabitants. Dream Land&#39;s demographics indicate that the Waddle Dee species make up the majority of the area&#39;s population. Besides the Waddle Dees, many other species live and thrive in Dream Land as well. The country is under the rule of King Dedede, the one and only King of [nation]Dedede Empire[/nation], who really has no interest in actually ruling.[/color]
