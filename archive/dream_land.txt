Dream Land&#39;s demographics indicate that the Waddle Dee species make up the majority of the area&#39;s population. Besides the Waddle Dees, many other species live and thrive in Dream Land as well. The country is under the rule of King Dedede, the self-proclaimed dictator of Dream Land, who really has no interest in actually ruling[/b].[/color] 

[b]Hail King Dedede![/b]
