Welcome to the [region]Brass Goggles League of Nations[/region]!

This is the unofficial region for all fans of Steampunk, and members of the Brass Goggles forum in particular. This region was founded by BG member Akumabito who plays this game under the pseudonym [nation]Thiemaa[/nation]. If you would like a custom designed flag for your nation, just send me a message and I&amp;#39;ll cook something up for you. If there is sufficient interest, a RPG could be started so we can excercise some proper diplomacy.

A useful link to check occasionally is the [url=http://tracker.conquestofabsolution.com/]Absolution NS Tracker[/url], which will give you more information on your Nation&amp;#39;s economy, including total budget, budget breakdowns, GDP and GDP per capita. Very interesting to compare nations!
