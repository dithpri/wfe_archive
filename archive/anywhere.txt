[color=grey][i]Cats sleep, anywhere,
Any table, any chair
Top of piano, window-ledge,
In the middle, on the edge,
Open drawer, empty shoe,
Anybody&#39;s lap will do,
Fitted in a cardboard box,
In the cupboard, with your frocks-
Anywhere! They don&#39;t care! 
Cats sleep anywhere.[/i][/color]
