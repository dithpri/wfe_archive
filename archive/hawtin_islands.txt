The Hawtin Islands are a set of islands, located in a remote corner untethered by any major nations or regions. The region&amp;#39;s founder, the nation of Novaci, enjoys limitless power, but prefers to take a hands off approach in regards to the islands. Any nation in the world is invited to visit the islands and the residents and all are allowed to permanently bring their nation into the ever-expanding borders of the region.
