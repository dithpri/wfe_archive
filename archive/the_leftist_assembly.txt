[quote=the_final_horseman;36270549]Perhaps the most remarkable thing about our region has been the ability for its leaders to pass the torch to their successors. We are a region of many minds, and our culture is that of change. I am confident our Assembly will not merely scrape by in the years to come, but it is my utmost belief that we will prosper.[/quote]
