    A group of true Orthodox nations of ex-Soviet origin located in the Carpathian Mountains of what was Ukraine. While many hold differing ideologies and governmental systems, this sect of the &amp;#39;Old Believers&amp;#39; are united in faith and trade agreements. Our motto is &amp;#39;Pravoslaviye prezhde chem ideologii&amp;#39; meaning &amp;#39;Orthodoxy over Ideology&amp;#39;.
