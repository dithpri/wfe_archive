After removing themselves from the [region]Cape of Good Hope[/region] the [color=green]leader nation[/color], [nation]Oansi[/nation] somehow moved the entire country to [region]Regioa[/region]. After scientists studied the land intensively, it was decided that the [color=red]barren landscape[/color] and [color=red]radioactive animals[/color] were a result of [color=orange]nuclear fallout[/color]. The cause, and reason for the fallout are unknown, as no past data has been recovered. It&#39;s a [color=green]large land[/color], and some places are [color=red]unsuitable for humans[/color], so if you log a message, don&#39;t expect it to be responded to soon. As said, the region is for nations that may be inactive for some time. It can also be considered a passing region, for nations who don&#39;t have a home.
