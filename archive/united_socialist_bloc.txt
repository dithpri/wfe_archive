If you are interested in making your nation the best possible, but would like to collaborate with the international audience, join the United Socialist Bloc. We strictly forbid our members from joining the World Assembly, because while unity is great, an obnoxious number of nations voting on issues is extraneous. Our Bloc will keep all issues within.
