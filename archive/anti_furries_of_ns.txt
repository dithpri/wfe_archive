Folks, in this world there are plenty of different people. Some groups are cool, others are a little weird. There&#146;s quite a few I disapprove of, but there hasn&#146;t really been any regions I&#146;ve seen going against this group, and that is why I am creating it. To discuss them with likeminded people and just talk about anything, and I hope that we can agree on most things. While we dislike the fandom as well, we hate the ones that are weirdos interested in animal porn, but think the whole thing is weird too.

Rules
1. Be respectful
2. Furries and pro-furry messaging will be suppressed
3. Debate will be allowed but furries or furry supporters will likely be ejected
