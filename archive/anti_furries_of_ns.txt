Folks, in this world there are plenty of different people. Some groups are cool, others are a little weird. There&#146;s quite a few I disapprove of, but there hasn&#146;t really been any regions I&#146;ve seen going against this group, and that&#146;s why AFoNS exists. To discuss them with likeminded people and just talk about anything, and I hope that we can agree on most things. While we dislike the fandom as well, we hate the ones that are degens interested in animal porn, whole thing is weird.
