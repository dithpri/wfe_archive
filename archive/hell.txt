[b]HELL 

 Back under [color=red]Native [/color]control

Comings and goings in Hell will be carefully monitored and controlled for the next few weeks. Until further notice, newcomers must be recommended by one of the Lords of Hell, and be approved by me or Freddland..

Nations wishing to move to Hell must go to [region]The Red Empire of the Toad[/region] first. Freddland will give you further instruction there.
