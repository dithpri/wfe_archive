[b]WA Nations: Endorse the Delegate. Do so upon arriving in Hell. All new arrivals are to telegram me or my Chief of Intelligence with there WA status upon arrival. If you do not know who that is, do not worry, he will be contacting you in short order. Nations refusing to do so will be ejected. A second ejection comes with a ban. I advise future delegates to adopt the same policy.[/b]
