The great nations that are a part of Marmion Land, were first joined by Mark Waitkus during the 17th Lateran Council in 1943. They convened and decided that the nations could thrive better under one regional council. Mark served as the first leader of the region until his forced resignation, for corrupt government policy and his cruel &quot;Death, or Exile,&quot; punishments, earlier this year. Upon his resignation, it was decided that the nation of Mariganbus would take control of Marmion Land. Long live Marmion.
