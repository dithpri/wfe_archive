This regions served alongside the [region]Confederacy of Layem[/region] for nearly 2 years. We have taken it into our own hands to preserve, and hopefully one day, give back to our long lost friends. Our times together were not forgotten, and we will always appreciate the loyalty this region showed during our times of crisis..

For now this region is under protection by the [region]Layem Auxiliary Force[/region]. Hail Layem!
