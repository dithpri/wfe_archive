Welcome to the Rhenish Republic, a democratic republic of 29 million in Central Europe, made up of the cultural regions of the Rhineland, Hesse, Westphalia and Palatinate
We are a constitutionally neutral nation, meaning that we will not enter alliances, albeit we look forward to establish diplomatic relations with other regions via embassies.
This region serves to improve ties with other regions, and thus does not take in other nations. (Other nations part of this region are the cultural regions of the Rhenish Republic, which have foreign offices)

- Armin Laschet, Prime Minister of the Rhenish Republic
