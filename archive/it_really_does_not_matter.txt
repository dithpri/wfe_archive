[color=red]Welcome to the final station, a region named after another ELO song - but this time its message is actually rather symbolic and optimistic - no matter what[/color] [color=green]happened this year, right now I&#39;m happy (and I hope you are too), and with Europeia I found what I was looking for, in large parts thanks to you &amp;lt;3[/color]
[color=red]I hope you enjoyed this little tribute, and belatedly Merry Christmas again! One last factbook with some more Christmas cheer![/color]
