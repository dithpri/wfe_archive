[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region], had an issue. A very, very serious issue. They were out of [color=pink]bubble gum[/color] for the [u]third time this week![/u] Desperate for their favorite chewies, the bubbleless birds swooped through your region, grabbing all the gum they could find before returning to the nest! If you want to share your bubble gum with us, if there is even anymore left, [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]come join us![/url]
