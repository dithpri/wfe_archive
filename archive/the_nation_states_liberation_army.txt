The Nation States Liberation Army is dedicated to protecting regions freed by the Security Council, and to freeing others who are not. We fight against raiding groups such as The Black Riders by invading regions they have captured and freeing them. We are open to any nation who would like to join and help promote international peace and goodwill. We encourage nations to change their flags to our regional flag when they go on campaign, so that we fight for justice under a common banner. If you have any questions, please contact [nation]Supreme Freedom[/nation]. 
Gathering members to launch  campaign.
