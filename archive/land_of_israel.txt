Shalom
There is so much more to Israel beyond the conflict, negativity portrayed by the media. The reality of daily life in Israel-people living ordinary lives in an extraordinary place.In Remembrance of the Holocaust victim 6 million Jews died during WWII who didn&amp;#39;t get their chance to make aliyah to Israel. Shabbat Shalom

Meanwhile if you&amp;#39;re interested to make Aliyah please contact our [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=israelity]Security Council[/url] to get the regional password

We will be thinking of you tonight, as we light the first candle on the hanukkiah. Let us rejoice together in the miracles of Hanukkah and the miracles that G-d is doing today in our lives be illuminated with the Light of the World.

Happy Hanukkah
