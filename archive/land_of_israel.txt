Shalom [color=blue]Welcome To The Land of Israel[/color]

We are Jewish and supporter of Israel and the beautiful Jerusalem. The reality of daily life in Israel - people living ordinary lives in an extraordinary place. As you know, there is so much more to Israel beyond the conflict and negativity portrayed by the majority of Eastern and Western media. The Holy Land offers a refreshingly positive insight into many other aspects of Israel. Israel considered as holy to the three major religions&#151;Judaism, Christianity and Islam.[/i]
