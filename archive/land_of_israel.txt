[color=blue]Welcome To The Land of Israel[/color]

We&amp;#39;re jewish &amp;amp; supporter of Israel. As you know, there is so much more to Israel beyond the conflict and negativity portrayed by the majority of Eastern &amp;amp; Western media. The Holy Land offers a refreshingly positive insight into many other aspects of Israel.

The reality of daily life in Israel - people living ordinary lives in an extraordinary place, Israel considered as holy to the Judaism, Christianity and Islam. In Remembrance of The Holocaust victim 5.934 million Jews died during WWII who didn&amp;#39;t get their chance to make aliyah to Israel. Shabbat Shalom
