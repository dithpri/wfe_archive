Welcome to Land of Israel. This region boldly dedicated for Israeli educational environment curriculum for understanding politics, ethical dilemmas, nature of freedom, society &amp;amp; patriotism. 

There is so much more to Israel beyond the conflict and negativity portrayed by the majority of Eastern &amp;amp; Western media. The Holy Land offers a refreshingly positive insight into many other aspects of Israel. The reality of daily life in Israel - people living ordinary lives in an extraordinary place, Israel considered as holy to the Judaism, Christianity and Islam. In Remembrance of the Holocaust victim 6 million Jews died during WWII who didn&amp;#39;t get their chance to make aliyah to Israel. Shabbat Shalom
