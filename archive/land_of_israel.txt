[color=blue]Welcome To The Land of Israel[/color]

We&amp;#39;re jewish &amp;amp; supporter of Israel and the beautiful of Jerusalem. As you know, there is so much more to Israel beyond the conflict and negativity portrayed by the majority of Eastern &amp;amp; Western media. The Holy Land offers a refreshingly positive insight into many other aspects of Israel.

The reality of daily life in Israel - people living ordinary lives in an extraordinary place, Israel considered as holy to the Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Israel has the highest ratio of defense spending to GDP and as a percentage of the budget of all developed countries.

In Remembrance of The Holocaust victim 5.934 million Jews died during WWII who didn&amp;#39;t get their chance to make aliyah to Israel. Shabbat Shalom
