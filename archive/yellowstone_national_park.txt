[b]World&#39;s Largest Collection of Geysers[/b]

It&#39;s a wonderland. Old Faithful and the majority of the world&#39;s geysers are preserved here. They are the main reason the park was established in 1872 as America&#39;s first national park&#151;an idea that spread worldwide. A mountain wildland, home to grizzly bears, wolves, and herds of bison and elk, the park is the core of one of the last, nearly intact, natural ecosystems in the Earth&#146;s temperate zone.&#151;[url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm][color=990000]Yellowstone National Park Service[/color][/url][hr]
