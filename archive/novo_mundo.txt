[b][u]Welcome to Novo Mundo!
An alternate-history RP region[/u][/b]


Novo Mundo is set in a world where Germany won the Great War. It is now 1950, and the world is in the process of recovering from yet another world war. The powers of old have been weakened by a war on multiple fronts. Now a cold war is brewing between Russia, Germany, and Britain as they race to rebuild their nations in order to re-establish their lost power. [hr]
