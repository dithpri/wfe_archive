[B][Region]The Black Hawks[/region] gathered around a cozy campfire tonight after conquering a number of small regions prompting a number of topics for the conversations at hand, such as the fun of mobile raiding, plotting how to trigger with a loaf of bread, our AI overlords turning manual raiding obsolete, (and a particular capitalist segment of the convo almost caused Zizou to leave.) If you&#39;re jealous of the amazing fun we had, then [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org]come join us[/url] to roast s&#39;mores and tell spooky stories around the fire.
