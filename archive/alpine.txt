The Alpine Region is a small Northern Continent, and some outlying islands and connected regions. We are known for our Majestic Pines, High Cliffs, which tower over the waters edge, Multiple mountain ranges extending into the distant horizon, the many wolves and other creatures which inhabit our forest and mountain regions, and a general &amp;quot;Do-It-Yourself&amp;quot; outlook on life.
