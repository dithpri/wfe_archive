[b][color=0051a1]We are now retiring this region so that it can be reborn and have a chance to thrive with new life.[/color][/b]

We spoke with an old native of this region in his discord on [u]4/23/2018[/u], and he gave us his blessing to retire this region (if we can). [i]He actually thought that the region was already retired.[/i]

Thanks for helping by not interfering.
