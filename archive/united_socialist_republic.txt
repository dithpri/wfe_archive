The USR was created to form a new world. A place where every man and woman is treated equal. I know that most socialisms fall apart. But this one is diffrent. We allow our citizens to vote on issues. The votes will help government officals decied on certain issues. We also have elections. The government picks certain people to run and then the citizens vote for them.
