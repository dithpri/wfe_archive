fighting for the transcendence of every soul, no person will be left behind. 
we believe all people should be equal but at the same time equality is not justice these things can get confusing but dont worry about it.
a lot of funding goes to the spirituality department helping people find their true selfs. 
we do not reject anyone who is willing to better themselves into our society
