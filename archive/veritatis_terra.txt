The Land of Truth is a region compromised of strong nations allied together by military force, and willing to defend their land, even if it means destroying yours. We accept no corruption, and we deny those whom would bring it to us. None shall tread on the Land of Truth, and none shall stay to lie. None are above our scrutiny.
