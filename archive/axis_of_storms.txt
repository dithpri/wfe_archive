Welcome to the Axis of Storms!

Any nation can join the Axis of Storms, but they must change their flag to look either more Fascist (Example: Replace blue with Black.), more Anarchist (any anarchist flag should do), or more Conservative (For Democracies).

Should anyone try to invade, a new community will be made with password protection.

Also, Fascist Puppets (or, really, any other puppet) can be stored here.

You don&#39;t have to be facist. In fact, Nibiru will guide you with Anarchism.

Region hopper friendly, but don&#39;t be stupid.
