[b][region]Whitesky Peak[/region] is a freezing snowy region with temperatures as high as 30&deg; to as low as -16&deg;. It also houses the Island of Takaar where the [nation]Kutizali Gosa[/nation] lies, the Mid Ice island, Oil Rock Island, Ice Ridge Island, and Mammoth Island. These islands are separated by ocean water that&#39;s too dangerous for anyone. Hypothermia is mainly the regions cause of death but with the right clothing and heat. The Tribal nation&#39;s living on these islands will sustain. Further more, only true tribal (as in flint Spears and flint arrows) nation&#39;s may join this very forsaken region. Modern Nation&#39;s are our enemies, technology of any kind is forbidden in this region.[/b]
