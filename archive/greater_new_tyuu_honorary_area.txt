-A large region composed mostly of the ocean, which is good as we heavily really on hydro-power
-It is very warm, which is also good, as we ALSO really on solar power
-An economically sound region, so no trouble there
-We rule our people with an iron fist; no one gets out, hardly anyone gets in,
so as long as you don&amp;#39;t start sticking your nose into our private business, we
should get along just fine . . .
