Part of Hawaiian culture, &amp;#699;ohana means family (in an extended sense of the term, including blood-related, adoptive or intentional). The concept emphasizes that families are bound together and members must cooperate and remember one another. The term is similar in meaning and usage to the New Zealand M&amp;#257;ori term wh&amp;#257;nau, and its cognate in M&amp;#257;ori is k&amp;#333;hanga, meaning &quot;nest&quot;.

In Hawaiian, the word &amp;#699;ohana begins with an &amp;#699;okina, indicating a glottal stop.
