&quot;[i]Its Portuguese name[color=green] (Macau)[/color]seems to have its origin in one of the first landing sites for Portuguese navigators, the Bay of A-M&aacute; (in Cantonese, &quot;A-Ma Kong&quot;), a name that is due to the existence in that bay of a temple in honor of the goddess A-Ma. A-Ma Gao would become, Amacao, Macao and, finally,[color=green]Macau[/color]&quot;  [/i]
