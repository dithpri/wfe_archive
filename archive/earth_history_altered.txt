The alternate 21st century, a world where the Soviet Union was crippled in the beginning of WWII and broke shortly after the war.
A world where Erwin Rommel rose to power after Hitler&#39;s demise and united the two Germanies swiftly.
A world where the United States of America split into two after the Watergate scandal and has stayed that way to the present day.
A world where new nations rise and fall at the whims of fate.
