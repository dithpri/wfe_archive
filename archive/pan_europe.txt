[Color=yellow]Welcome to Pan Europe, your regional hub to link all states, territories and historical lands of the [nation]Pan-European State[/nation].

Embassies will most likely be denied but if sent a convincing telegram to [nation]Pan-Europe Administrator[/nation], your embassy could be accepted.

Nations that aren&#39;t Pan-Europe&#39;s, can reside here/in other affiliated regions if they wish to. Do not expect active communication, or polls.
