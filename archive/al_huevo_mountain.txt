It&amp;#39;s modern cities on mountains that have vantage point against invaders but if you don&amp;#39;t mind we don&amp;#39;t want invaders. People are happy here (at points) with their friends and family, it&amp;#39;s peaceful (also at points) but they get along. By the way don&amp;#39;t invade because we said that we don&amp;#39;t like invaders.
