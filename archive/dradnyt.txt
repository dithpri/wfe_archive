Dradnyt is a Scandinavian environment: A wide mountain range filled with snow surrounds a copse of woodland. The forest in the middle is a cradle of life for the hardiest of winter creatures. The ice is always pure, and drinking water is never an issue. Timber wolves and bears are a common problem, but one that is often overcome by the burly human inhabitants. Large, wooly cows are a common form of livestock, and beef production drives agriculture. Nearby landlocked glaciers are displayed as natural wonders.
