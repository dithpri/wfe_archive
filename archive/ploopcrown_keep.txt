[b]Looking for a place to relax and argue with people over Dom and NAIS&#39;s friendship? Come join us here in Ploopcrown Keep! We have roleplay that never updates because of the US election, a &quot;democratic&quot; government, and an obedient population of hearty dom worshippers! We like to help newer nations, but older ones get most of the benefits! Make sure to ploop on our [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=display_region_rmb/region=bluecrown_keep]Message Board[/url], and soon be spammed with [nation]Barlyy[/nation]yy keeping you from existing. And endorse Prime Minister [nation]Nooooooooooooooo[/nation], and respect your [color=red][i]g u l a g[/i][/color] [nation]Ploopy[/nation]![/b]

[b][i]And no supporting the Browns! Or we will send you to [u][color=red][nation]Sorianora[/nation][/color][/u][/i][/b]
