[b]Looking for a place to relax and argue with people over The Jared Scandal? Come join us here in Ploopcrown Keep! We don&#39;t have roleplay and it wouldn&#39;t update anyway because of me, a &quot;democratic&quot; government, and an obedient population of hearty lutheran baloo worshippers! We like to help newer nations, but older ones get most of the benefits! Make sure to ploop on our [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=display_region_rmb/region=neutraikea]Message Board[/url], and soon be spammed with [nation]Barlyy[/nation]yy keeping you from existing. And endorse Prime Minister [nation]sori[/nation], and respect your [color=red][i]g u l a g[/i][/color] [nation]Ploopy[/nation]![/b]

[b][i]And no being soviet! Or we will send you to [u][color=red]g r u l a g[/color][/u][/i][/b]
