After the establishment of a communist Poland, the Polish government-in-exile set up Secret Poland in order to defend the sovereignty of their peoples against the influences of the USSR.  Altogether democracy has returned to Poland, the citizens of Secret Poland continue to insist that they are a separate nation.  Secret Poland refuses to recognize the new government until Lvov is once again in Polish hands and Kebab is removed.  In total, the region of Secret Poland encompasses a majority of the known world, but because of its confidential nature, most of its citizens do not know that they are within its jurisdiction.
