Bantu is based of a vast geographical area of sub-Saharan Africa where Bantu-speaking people are found, including West, Central, East, and Southern Africa. These peoples originated in a region near present-day Cameroon and Nigeria and spread across the continent over thousands of years, developing hundreds of distinct ethnic groups that share common linguistic roots. There are over 400 different ethnic groups that encompass this region, with some of the largest groups including the Zulu (South Africa), Shona (Zimbabwe), Xhosa (Southern Cape) and Kongo (Central Africa).
