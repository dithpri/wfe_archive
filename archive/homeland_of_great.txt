The Homeland of Great is a region for nations that value more than just dead democracy or cheap populism. Anyone can join, but it might be difficult to stay. We don&#39;t value the virtues of the French Revolution and we don&#39;t tolerate social apathy or resentment/reaction. You need to be a creator, not a reactant. We don&#39;t tolerate morality being leveled down and made with &quot;injustice&quot; or &quot;inequality&quot; in mind. The Homeland of Great is a sanctuary for the Sovereignty of Spirit. Here, we do not recognize the equality of the stagnant, but the hierarchy of the excellent. We replace the &#39;Rights of Man&#39; with the &#39;Duties of Greatness&#39;.
