[b]With over nine years of history, TNI is one of the oldest active player-made regions on NationStates. Originally one of the
most infamous raiding powers, TNI was the first and only region to conquer the Rejected Realms. We have gradually transitioned into an active RP region.

This region is a dead region for a while now. After the active government that was responsible for making sure that this region was even alive had decided that the region wasnt going anywhere, A new region, [region]The Exalted Lands[/region], was created to host the successor of TNI, at least in spirit. Join that region if you want actual activity.
