The Sithid are a warlike and powerful reptillian species, roaming from land to land and leaving little past death and destruction in their wake.  They, however, are not an invasive people and spend most of their time fighting amongst their own clans for sport. 

Cross the Sithid and face a force you have likely not seen before.
