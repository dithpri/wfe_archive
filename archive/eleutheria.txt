Eleutheria is a fairly large region, composed of anything from great mountain ranges, to the most supine of plains. Eleutheria was founded when great amount of people fled their nations in search of a more unthreatened, open land. Eleutherian nations all share the same presuppositions that states should have great freedoms (with some moderation.), as not to follow in the path of their aforementioned countries. 

    As of modern day Eleutheria is a very clean shire, thriving with wildlife and natural beauty. The states get along very well, and succor each other as much as possible. Eleutheria is still grabbing the attention of many people in search of isolation from their former, oppressed nations.
