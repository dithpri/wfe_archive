[i]There is no God except Alloh,
Muhammad is the slave and the final chosen prophet of Alloh.[/i]

Peace be on you. Welcome to the Muslim Nation.

We are slaves of Alloh. We aquire peace by submitting to Alloh. We are Muslims.

Our way of life is Islam, the path which is set by Alloh.

There are five pillars of Islam: Shahadah, Solah, Zakah, Hajj and Sowm. And the roof of Islam is Jihad. Islam is based on the Quran, which contains the orders of Alloh.

If something doesn&#39;t contradict Alloh&#39;s orders, we accept it. Otherwise we reject it. Alloh is The Truth, even if everyone disagree with Him.

All praise is for Alloh, The Sustainer of the worlds. Peace and nearness be on His prophets and messengers. May Alloh guide us to His straight path. Ameen.
