[i]There is no God except Alloh,
Muhammad is the servant and the final prophet of Alloh.[/i]

Peace be on you. Welcome to the Muslim Nation.

We are the servant of Alloh. We aquire peace by submitting and surrendering to Alloh. We are Muslims.

Our way of life is Islam, the way of life which is set by Alloh.

There are five pillars of Islam: Shahadah, Solah, Zakah, Hajj and Soum. And the roof of Islam is Jihad. Islam is based on the Quran, which contains the orders of Alloh.

If something doesn&#39;t contradict the orders of Alloh, we accept it. Otherwise we reject it. We don&#39;t care about the criticism of the people, we only care about the orders of Alloh.

May Alloh guide us to His straight path. Ameen.
