Originally a simple mass of islands, the idea of [b]The Collective Comadisian Islands[/b] was originally proposed to [nation]Daghdha[/nation] and [nation]Gelmhad[/nation] by [nation]Lucaein[/nation]. The Collective Comadisian Islands are a Free Region, although with restricted entry. There are no Region-Wide Legislations or Laws, but entry into the region is strictly regulated and controlled by all Member Nations for reasons of Security and National Wellbeing, as well as upkeep of Regional and National Reputations.
