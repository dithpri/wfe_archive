[color=#347235][b][u]The Region of Adrastos[/u][/b][/color] 
It&amp;#39;s your world; make it so. Adrastos is a region of people wanting to cooperate (or fight) in a semi-realistic in character setting while maintaining a friendly, open atmosphere out of roleplay. You are welcome no matter who you are; young or old, new or a veteran dating back to pre-Jolt days, you can come in and kick off your shoes.
