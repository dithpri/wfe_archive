[list][b][color=Mediumaquamarine]The Northern Lights[/color][/b]

[color=seagreen]An aurora is a natural light display in the sky particularly in the high latitude regions. In northern latitudes, the effect is known as the [b]aurora borealis[/b] or the [b]Northern Lights[/b], named after the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas, by Pierre Gassendi in 1621. Auroras seen near the magnetic pole may be high overhead, but from farther away, they illuminate the northern horizon as a greenish glow or sometimes a faint red, as if the Sun were rising from an unusual direction.[/color][hr]
