Welcome! The Kingdom of New France is a region that is mainly situated along the foundation of French Louisiana (Basically the Louis &amp; Clark expedition never happened and France kept the West) and in the West Indies. The Kingdom offers free access for all countries and the ability to debate within its borders. Once we reach 14 member states, we will begin to elect recruiters via telegram. The elections are done by a yay-nay approval from the council (First Four member states and/or chosen) and a final endorsement from an Executive Authority official.
