The Great Horusian Empire is a modern day, confederal multi-ethnic complex of territories on the continent of Greater Horusia, encompassing the majority of its landmass. Its constituent states are independent and largely sovereign monarchies, principalities, duchies, counties, baronies and other such entities, yet all are united by the might and majesty of the Imperial Crown, the sovereign authority on the whole of the Great Horusian Empire.
