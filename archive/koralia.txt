This was a triumph.
I&#39;m making a note here:
huge success.
It&#39;s hard to overstate
My satisfaction.
Aperture Science.
We do what we must
Because we can.
For the good of all of us.
Except the ones who are dead.

But there&#39;s no sense crying
Over every mistake.
You just keep on trying
Till you run out of cake.
And the Science gets done.
And you make a neat gun.
For the people who are
Still alive.
