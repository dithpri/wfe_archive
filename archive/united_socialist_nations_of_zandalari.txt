Welcome to the USNZ, we originally started as a group of like minded people who wanted to achieve international fame. We have changed our thoughts, and while we wish fame so that we can continue to do good for the world and its people, we no longer require exactly like minded; we still wish you to have great civil rights and political rights, but your economy doesn&#39;t not need to be socialist per se..

So come one, come all! You&#39;ll like it here, if you aren&#39;t sure you will, ask any of us why we are here, or anything really!

Salut! Nous parlons le fran&ccedil;ais aussi! Si vous voulez, nous pouvons aider-vous avec tout les probl&egrave;mes vous avez :D!
