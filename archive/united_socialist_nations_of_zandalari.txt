Welcome to the USNZ, a collection of countries to follow the say goal of obtaining the perfect balance of rights and freedoms for the people.

The people of USNZ should be more or less free to do whatever they please, so long that it does not impede on other&amp;#39;s freedoms, rights, and the basic things life needs, unless the situation absolutely needs to.We welcome freedoms and liberties for the people. However so long you aren&amp;#39;t oppressing your people, it is acceptable to join the USNZ even if you aren&amp;#39;t socialist, we allow anyone and everyone that has good intents. (Kerbal Space Program is the exception, it is our joint space program[The game displays them wrongly as a dictatorship/police state])
So welcome, and enjoy the world that should be!
