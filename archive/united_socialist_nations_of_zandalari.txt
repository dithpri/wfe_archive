Welcome to the USNZ, a collection of countries to follow the say goal of obtaining the perfect balance of rights and freedoms for the people.

We shun anarchy  due to fear, anxiety, and many, somehow often unforeseen consequences. The people of USNZ should be more or less free to do whatever they please, so long that it does not impede on other&amp;#39;s freedoms, rights, and the basic things life needs, unless the situation absolutely needs to.

After the creation of the USSZ, the world committe decided to put the USSZ in the north pacific group of nations, however we felt that was quite unfair due to our south pacific location, and our strong need to be independent from other regions.

So welcome, and enjoy the world that should be!
