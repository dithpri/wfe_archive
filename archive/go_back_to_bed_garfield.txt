The State Department of [nation]crave that mineral[/nation] has hired several native Mineralian historians to craft a history of our glorious Republic. I have posted it here for all member nations of [region]Go Back to Bed Garfield[/region] so that they may properly inform their Foreign Ministries of how more delicate relations with our nation ought to be approached. We politely request that all member nations likewise invest in the production of historical record, so that we all may come to know one another better in international affairs.
