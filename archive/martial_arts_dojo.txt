This region was once a haven for the military forces of fascists. Unfortunately the defenders who took the responsibility of destroying this region have proven themselves to be unfit for the task. 

We at [b][region=Lone Wolves United][/b] and friends have decided it&#39;s our duty to assist them for the time being.

Special thanks to [b][region=The West Pacific][/b] for their long commitment as well as [b][region=The Mafia][/b] and [b][region=The Universal Allegiance][/b] for their dedicated support to this operation.
