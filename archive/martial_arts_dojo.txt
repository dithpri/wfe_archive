The fascists have fallen to the insurmountable forces of [b][region]The Order of the Grey Wardens[/region] and [region]Vvardenfell[/region]&#39;s Buoyant Armigers[/b]! These loathsome darkspawn attempt to spread their blight of hatred across NationStates and now find themselves at the edge of our swords. The Maker&#39;s mercy will not be shown here.

[i]Blessed are they who stand before
The corrupt and the wicked and do not falter.
Blessed are the peacekeepers, the champions of the just.[/i]
