This is a project started by New British Serfdom to unify Great Britain, Ireland, the islands of the north and all land that was owned by the United Kingdom.

So far in our plan we have conquered England, Wales, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, but our plan is not complete! This organization was started to collect funds from the taxpayers of New British Serfdom to unify the lost lands and bring an age of prosperity to the British people.

This is a long, taxing war, but it will be won, and we will be glorious!
