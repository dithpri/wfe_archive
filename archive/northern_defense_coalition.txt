The Northern Defense Coalition (NDC) is a region in NW. Siberia/SW. Russia. We pride ourselves on a strong regional defense force, and all players are welcome, but keep in mind we are NOT ultra serious, so don&amp;#39;t expect a utopia for dedicated RP, although I don&amp;#39;t mind if you create a nation here that is. We are currently modern tech, though, so NO ANCIENT OR FUTURE RP. Please join, and we can make a name for the NDC. FIRST 10 NATIONS TO JOIN GET SPECIAL POSITIONS.
