Just a region that in shape looks exactly like Europe... Literally in landscape and form, but the borders shall be filled with countless pony-fans who&amp;#39;s nation is supposed to be European. That counts Scandinavian, Eastern, The Balkans, Western Europe and the British isles, The Mediterranean, Iceland, Greenland, Turkey, the western Middle East and even Northern Africa and Egypt. So in generally.. A huge land space, lots of room for many pony nations.  I created this for uttermost realism. Hopefully I made all those wanting a European-western middle eastern or Northern African like pony nation, empire, kingdom, democracy or other forms of Government have a much more easy time.
