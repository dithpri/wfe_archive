&amp;quot;When life gives you lemons, don&amp;#39;t make lemonade. Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don&amp;#39;t want your damn lemons, what the hell am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life&amp;#39;s manager! Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am? I&amp;#39;m the man who&amp;#39;s gonna burn your house down! With the lemons! I&amp;#39;m gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!&amp;quot; - Cave Johnson, Lord and Savior
