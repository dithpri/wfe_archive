[b]Welcome to Region Of Northern Democratika![/b]

Region refounded by [region]Jafazia[/region] from [region]Archai[/region]&#39;s clutches.[hr]

The region was plunged under the dictatorship of [region]Archai[/region], who controlled [nation]Suprita[/nation] to rule with an iron fist all the defenseless nations in the region, but the clamor of the region reached [region]Jafazia[/region], who organized a military expedition to overthrow [nation]Suprita[/nation] and [region]Archai[/region] from power, restoring peace and tranquility to the region.[hr]

[b]Long live Jafazia, long live Democratika![/b]
