[color=blue][b]Once a thriving region, made by my friend and ally, [nation]Suprita[/nation].[/color]
[color=red]But then Jafazia came.
Jafazia burnt the region to the ground. He left nothing...[/color]

[color=purple]But then, out of the midst of the chaos, the Dual Galaxies of [region]Archai[/region] noticed the disarray, and that Suprita had been thrown out of power...
[region]Archai[/region] decided to grant [nation]Suprita[/nation]&#39;s nation&#39;s final wish, and liberate [region]Region of Northern Democratika[/region], so that his nation could rest in peace...

The Galactic Hand of [region]Archai[/region] reaches down, pulling R.O.N.D off of the earth, and out of Jafazia&#39;s iron grasp, and to our orbiting galaxies.
Here, you are safe [nation]Suprita[/nation]...

We wait for your return.[/b][/color]

[b]Peace, Justice, Prosperity,

Here signs out, the once-used Liberation Force of [region]Archai[/region]...[/b]
