Piltover, also known as the Region of Progress, is the leading center of ecologically-minded techmaturgical research in the world. The region&amp;#39;s great academies and their contributions to science are known across the world, rivaled only by the eccentric colleges found in bigger regions. Strangely, the coastal region is situated atop a relatively small mountain in a vast greenish marsh. The denizens of Piltover appear to be utilizing the liquid and gases emitting from the marsh as a viable source of energy in order to power the region.
