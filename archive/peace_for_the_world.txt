If you don&#39;t seek peace then you may not enter. Peace For The World is only meant for those who want peace. If you have a problem then speak with me. Do not force my hand, I can be aggressive if the time calls for it. If you want to start a war, you will be removed from Peace For The World for two months. We don&#39;t accept violence here.

The leader of &quot;FORTHEMEMES&quot;
