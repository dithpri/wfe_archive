[color=red][b]Hello and welcome to Create![/b][/color]

[color=maroon][b]If you&amp;#39;re wondering why the region name is[/color] [color=gold]Create[/color][color=maroon], I wanted something[/color] [color=magenta]a[/color][color=orange]r[/color][color=gold]t[/color][color=green]s[/color][color=blue]y[/color] [color=maroon]and meaningful. I also love getting creative![/color][/b]

[color=blue][b]I want to make a big, fun community inside this region where people get along well and have fun! I&amp;#39;m looking for a diverse group of nations from newbies to oldies (maybe I&amp;#39;ll learn something too!) :-)[/color][/b]

[color=gold][b]Please understand that I am probably not as old as some of the other players are. I have a harder time getting the meaning of certain words or how to do this or that so please help me out in advance![/color][/b]

[color=green][b]Thank you for supporting me by joining[/color] [color=rainbow]Create![/Color] [color=green]I will be making a link to a chat board or forum soon![/color][/b]
