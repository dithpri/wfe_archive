&amp;quot;The Humanitarian League was once a proud region of roleplayers. It lasted for over a year and was an influential region in its time but fell with the schism of the Humanitarian League into [b][region]Nysa[/region][/b] and [region]Noctur[/region]. The Humanitarian League remains today as a non-regional international organisation within Noctur, while a new assembly the Nysan Organisation has replaced it in [region]Nysa[/region]. Each remains dedicated to the rights of people, a proud legacy for the Humanitarian League to have passed on.

[b]This region is hereby under the protection of [region]Nysa[/region], to be held in trust as a memorial to the Humanitarian League.[/b]&amp;quot;
