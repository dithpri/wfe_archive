The Octessence is made up of eight powerful principalities. Roughly a thousand years ago, they disagreed on which of them was the most powerful. To settle the question they entered into the Wager of the Octessence. Each placed a small fraction of its magical might into a token and then established a temple on Earth to house it. The first human to find and touch the artifact would gain the power and lose his will to the artifact&#39;s master, becoming an Exemplar: a creature of focused magical might. Then the Exemplars would divide the world into eighths and each would battle the others until only one remained. It is here that they now reside, eternally watching the war they created.
