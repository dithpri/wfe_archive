[b][color=998FC7]This former fascist trophy has been refounded by the Sekhmet Legion of [region]Osiris[/region] and [nation]Kingdom of Circle of Magi[/nation] of [region]The Order of the Grey Wardens[/region].[/color]

[color=058ED9]We&#39;re happy to refound any other fash tings you leave founderless so please do so more often! It was delightful, and particularly enlightening to see just how the basic security of keeping a nation alive seemed out of reach for those who formerly occupied this region. ;)[/color]

[color=998FC7]If you&#39;re interested in bashing fascist regions and their trophies/territories, please feel free to join either of our regions. We&#39;re always welcoming of new blood to support the cause.[/color]

[color=058ED9]Toodles![/color]
