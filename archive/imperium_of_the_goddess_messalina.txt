[quote=NationStates Moderators;33942088]Alrighty, before folks go &quot;OMG WHAT HAPPENED?!&quot;
1) Founder DEAT for PG-13 violations across RMB and dispatches.
2) Seneca and puppets DEAT for PG-13 violations across RMB and regional WFEs, moderation team will be discussing DOS as this is not her first time getting in trouble for such.

Moderation has very little patience for these sorts of antics. If you are only here to engage in your personal BDSM dom fetish, Nationstates is NOT the place for it. This sort of stuff is what got Jadny DOSed. Keep carrying on in the same manner she did, and DOS lies in your future too.
