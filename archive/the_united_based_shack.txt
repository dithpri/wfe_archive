A strong and nationalistic peoples tired of living life in a world that presents itself as democracy, when its clouded by the very freedoms by that it provides its citizens. For too long has the freedom of the people been allowed to oppress the individual minds. Activists, protestants and anti-political groups shunning those who think outside their box with different opinions of those. For no longer are we divided, for no longer are we shunned, for no longer are we stamped beneath the people who use freedom to take freedom and for no longer will we abide by the precious laws that they swear they uphold when they make a fuss about society.

In our nation, these groups are crushed, executed or indoctrinated in the way of our greatness!
