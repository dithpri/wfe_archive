The cogs of this earth, a continuation of eternity, follow their simple reason to forward themselves: to go beyond, but not to new, but to go beyond within itself. The constraint of balance is anything but what is to be strived for upon this earth. But to strive for the future is only to strive for ourselves; we are what we become. Striving for this reason is both consequence and the consequence of; that being of course, this blessing of knowledge. The fruit of such enlightenment does indeed relieve the future of its burden; however, preparation for the inevitable is only quintessential, aforementioned. Needless to the necessary, the inner truth awaits.
