[WIP]

Welcome to Estereia!

We&#39;re a fictional continent set in a fictional medieval world. We draw inspiration from LOTR, ASOIAF and Skyrim among others and we&#39;d be delighted if you&#39;d join us in our world of war, lore and political intrigue.

Roleplay will begin at some point next week and if you have any questions or just want to chat, join our discord server. The RMB is going to be kept strictly for RP.

Be sure to contact one of our admins, Norvath or Hargrad, for a spot on the map.
