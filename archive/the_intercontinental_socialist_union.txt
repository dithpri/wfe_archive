To unite under the idea that the wellbeing of the people goes above all else, and where we can establish an environment that discourages hate and permits open debate, and where we can look past our differences and celebrate our similarities, and where we can cooperate with each other to continue the promotion of camaradery, and where we can be a haven for those fleeing from unjust violence, and where we can defend ourselves when we unite against those who seek to harm anyone holding a different belief, the Intercontinental Socialist Union will be there. Long live the Union and their people.

Be respectful to each other.
