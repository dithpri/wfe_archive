&amp;#128679; REGION UNDER CONSTRUCTION &amp;#128679; 

This region is an alliance between nations of socialism, communism, or social democracies. The region does not claim a specific type of socialism as the best type. Though this region shall practice democracy, that does not mean authoritarian nations are not welcomed. Only far right/fascist nations are not welcomed. Roleplaying, political discussions and debating are encouraged. There is currently no constitution. Once this region reaches a certain size, we can work on a simple regional constitution. Feel free to talk about anything as long as it meets the NS guidelines.
