Hello, friend!, I am [nation]Servoth[/nation], long-time member of Vapor. Vapor is a steampunk RP group, as well as a region. You can visit the OOC thread, our main hub of operations, [url=https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=389785]here[/url]. The world we have created for ourselves is semi-realistic, though some fantasy tech is allowed.

Our story begins with an international conference on a continental railway system in 1880. Of course, as you should all know, time is not a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it&#39;s more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly, timey wimey...stuff. Therefore, our narrative at any given time may be taking place in 1885, 1910, 1935, 1795, or whenever happens to suit our fancy.
