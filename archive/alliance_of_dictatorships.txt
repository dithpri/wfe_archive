This region has been taken over by [color=red][b] The Vultures[/b][/color]!

Our base can be found [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=the_vultures]here[/url].


Invasion took place from 12/5/15 to 12/19/15, mostly because we were busy with other stuff. Anyway, we took this region as a holiday gift.
