This region was founded after the destruction of [region]Roses Without Thorns[/region] as a successor region. Quickly after it was founded, a former RWOT resident [nation]XXURBANXX[/nation] obtained the role of delegate. 
Unfortunately, [nation]XXURBANXX[/nation] is homophobic, which lead to the region getting a lot of (deserved) hate. Eventually they were ousted to a new region called [region]Auremont[/region], which was destroyed immediately after becoming a frontier.
