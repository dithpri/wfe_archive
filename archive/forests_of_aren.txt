A large island located in the North Sea, we are a land of close knit communities.
The tale of Aren dates way, way back, when the first nomads arrived on the island. Originally the whole island was ruled by one leader, but a nasty war broke out when the northern people invaded the south in search of food, due to the infamous winter storm. The leaders of the opposing armies were brothers, and when they could not keep control of their riotous generals, they split. This splintered until there were hundreds of factions all over Aren, all believing in separate causes. Some of the factions joined together to form a nation. High Aren was the first of these.
