[sub]&amp;#9835; [i]&quot;Okay, my friend, you want to cut me in
Well I hate to tell you, but it just won&#39;t happen
So thanks, but no
I think I&#39;m good to go
&#39;Cause I quite enjoy the life you say I&#39;m trapped in
Now I admire you, and that whole show you do
You&#39;re onto something, really it&#39;s something
But I live among the swells, and we don&#39;t pick up peanut shells
I&#39;ll have to leave that up to you&quot;[/i] &amp;#9835;[/sub]
