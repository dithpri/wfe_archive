The NHPS is a weak, but growing region, founded in the principle that, though democracy may allow all men to have their opinion known, too many people have opinions on things they know nothing about. Rather than allow mob rule, a specialized form of voting, meant to combat corruption and foolishness is utilized. If a debate over the legality of stem cells is in question, a scientist specializing in the field deserves a stronger vote.
With this new form of rule, as well as limited use of traditional democracy, the NHPS hopes to grow in strength not by rule of the masses, but of the wise.
