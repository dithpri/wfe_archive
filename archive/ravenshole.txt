Welcome to Ravenshole, a mountainous region dedicated to spirituality, niceness, and lack of government corruptness. 

Here we believe in not being the one to start a fight, but the one to finish it. We promise that you will have a say in World Assembly via. our delegate, and hope you have a nice stay in the Ravenshole region.
