Hail to the HANDS! [i]The Handlers[/i] of [i]All Nations Destructive Systems[/i].

The HANDS has fallen under new management! The head of trading affairs shall control our region from now on until I return. If you are reading this now though do not be saddened! The region is not password protected so please feel free to join in my absence. Also if you have questions or concerns please feel free to contact me, I am still willing to come back and give others admin privileges.

[i]-Until our paths may cross again. Strive ever onward![/i]
