Hail to the HANDS! The Handlers of All Nations Defense Strategy&#146;s.

The HANDS accept most embassy requests and is a pretty casual region. If you want to join there is no password, ranks are easy to gain and keep here. If you have any questions please feel free to ask. If you&#146;re interested in things such as role playing and government positions and such, we are open and flexible to new recommendations and ideas. Also this region is NOT DEAD, I know it looks like it but we are still going and hopefully keep going for the near future.
