Hail to the HANDS! [i]The Handlers[/i] of [i]All Nations Destructive Systems[/i].

Our region has almost entirely collapsed, but for the time we spent together, know that this region will pass with the memories of a caring and kind community.

[i]-Until our paths may cross again. Strive ever onward![/i]
