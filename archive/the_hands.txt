With our Thumbs we will push the buttons to destroy nations. We are a fairly new Hand with a small group of loyal nations. If you wish to join us then message the Palm (Founder) of the Hands. 

The Hands was founded by the fleeing nations of The Armed Republic of The United Radds and The Allied States of GatesEnd. This is a haven to all those seeking to be an extension of the Palm and go on.

There are two parties, the left and right fingers which control different aspects of the Hands. You may chose your side on joining. The two parties must meet and agree upon a problem by vote, if not then the movement can&#146;t pass. 

We are the strong, the mighty, the HANDS!
