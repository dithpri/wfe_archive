The Central Block is a regional organization in Eastern Europe and Central Asia made to cheer up relatively small or weak nations, together, to thrive and survive. This does not mean that those nations are all friendly to each others, somes even are hateful toward somes, but following the rise of superpower, they have no other choice than to unite.
