&quot;Today is a monumental day for these three nations! Today, our good people will witness the union of our sprawling Quifaan, the hard working Vosse-Mkye, and the battlescarred Saint Asonair. This has been a union long in the making, ever since we as a nation accepted the smaller island nations of Obrasar and Ir Orvical unto our name. Today, we accept the people of these two fledgling states under our wing, and today, we will spread prosperity. Long live Las!&quot; - Kascho Zymmur, President of Quifaan (Sep. 22, 2037)
