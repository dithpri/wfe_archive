A lush, green region is spread out before you. Redwoods stretch far above your head and golden flowers cover the ground. In the distance a lone mountain juts upwards, reaching towards the cloudless blue sky.

You have now entered the region known as Lotonikyol. We strive for freedom from oppression and openness among our nations. While you don&#39;t have to get along with everybody here, it is encouraged that you do not start any civil wars. If you have a complaint about a nation, please send Osvanir a telegram about it.
