Titan, Saturn&amp;#39;s largest moon, is the center of the Triumvirate of Yut, a multinational confederation with holdings and allies throughout the Solar System and beyond. Successfully terraformed [i]yedecemi[/i] ago, Titan&amp;#39;s surface is comfortably habitable for most humanoids with climates and biomes ranging from relatively arid steppes and mountains to temperate rainforests.
