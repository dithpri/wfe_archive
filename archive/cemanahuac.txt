&#39;The land between the waters&#39;

A [color=red]leftist[/color] region.

We like combat sports and other sports as well.

Anthropomorphic animals and insects, aliens, robots with free will and the like reside here alongside humans, so you know.

We&#39;re not here to take part, we&#39;re here to take over.
