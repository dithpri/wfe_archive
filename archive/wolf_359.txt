Wolf 359 is a desolate and haunting region of space, forever scarred by one of Starfleet&#146;s darkest moments. This is the site of a brutal battle against the Borg, where a powerful fleet was decimated, leaving behind only wreckage and silence. The remnants of Starfleet vessels drift aimlessly, a grim reminder of the cost of resistance against overwhelming force.

Many who pass through feel the weight of the loss and hear the faint echoes of the past. Yet, amid this devastation, there are still mysteries to uncover&#151;strange signals, unexplained anomalies, and the presence of the enigmatic Crystalline Entity.
