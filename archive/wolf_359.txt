Wolf 359 is a red dwarf star located in the constellation Leo, approximately 7.8 light-years from Earth, making it one of the closest stars to the Sun. 

It is a very faint star, classified as a spectral type M6V, with a surface temperature around 2,800 K. Despite its proximity, Wolf 359 is so dim that it cannot be seen with the naked eye, with an apparent magnitude of 13.5. It has about 9% of the Sun&#39;s mass and a radius of roughly 16% that of the Sun. 

Known for its low luminosity, Wolf 359 is a flare star, meaning it can experience sudden, unpredictable increases in brightness due to magnetic activity.
