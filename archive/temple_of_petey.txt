The Temple welcomes all who are willing to be confirmed within our religion, we accept any religion outside of ours, as long as it is safe. The only people we do not accept are the evil worshippers of Mog. Mog is a evil being who constantly gets into the heads of lost souls, and tortures them.
Anyone who is interested in funding the temple, is welcome to do so, but it is not required to pay. We at the temple respect, and love everyone equally. Trade within the temple is accepted, and our decisions will help us change the world.
