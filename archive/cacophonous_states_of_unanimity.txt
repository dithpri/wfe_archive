[b]Welcome to the Cacophonous States of Unanimity, the CSU. Please have your passport ready for inspection to avoid delay.[/b]

The Cacophonous States of Unanimity look upon all areas of the political spectrum with equal levels of respect and disdain, and treat all member states equals.

Nations in this region must abide by the rules of unilateral multilateralism, both with regards to national policy and regional representation. Or so the Declaration of Regional Promulgation says.
