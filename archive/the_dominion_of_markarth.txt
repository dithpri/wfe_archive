[color=goldenrod][b]Welcome to The Dominion of Markarth![/b][/color]
[i]Chaos isn&amp;#39;t a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some are given a chance to climb. They refuse, they cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.[/i]
