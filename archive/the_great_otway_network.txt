[b]Welcome to [color=green]The Great Otway Network[/color] (TGON)[/b], a region which focuses on national and character roleplay. 

The Great Otway Network is a roleplay server. Everything before 1800 is the same, but after that... things change. The British Empire falls in 1800, and is unable to regain a grasp. Some colonies gain indepence, never to see Britain again. Some stay. 1914 rolls around, and a war is on the verge of beginning. What will happen next?
