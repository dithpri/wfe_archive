We, the [colour=darkred][b]Stahlherzbund[/b][/colour] or [colour=darkred][b]SHB[/b][/colour] for short, are forged with the same steel &#150; the same values and principles. While we acknowlegde that none of us are identical to each other &#150; we are all equal allies and we seek integrity and unity.

For us, honor, dignity and sapient life are the most important things in the Galaxy, and because of that, we decide together, as a democratic senate, what the future shall bring us.

We are the [colour=darkred][b]Stahlherzbund[/b][/colour], we are united and we stand united together. 
As allies, as friends and as a family. 

[colour=darkblue][b]And as a family &#150; we will grow.[/b][/colour]
