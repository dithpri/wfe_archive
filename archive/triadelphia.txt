A region for nations that began at Triadelphia, Park, or anywhere in the Northern Panhandle, really.

Our region is still in its infancy, but growing rapidly.  As we grow, member nation-states must work together to develop a charter or constitution.  Suggestions are welcome.  For example charters of international organizations, see: [url=http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/]United Nations[/url] &amp;amp; [url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm]NATO[/url].


Go to [url=http://triadelphia.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=map&amp;amp;action=display&amp;amp;thread=1]Triadelphia&amp;#39;s[/url] offsite message board to see the map of &amp;quot;Triadelphia&amp;quot; by clicking on the link.  There is no need to register or post anything and I would actually prefer that you didn&amp;#39;t.  Read the directions , look at the map, and then claim your territory by being the first to write the number on the message board below.
