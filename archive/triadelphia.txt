A region for nations that began at Triadelphia, Park, or anywhere in the Northern Panhandle, really.

Our region is still in its infancy, but growing rapidly.  As we grow, member nation-states must work together to develop a charter or constitution.  Suggestions are welcome.  For example charters of international organizations, see: [url=http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/]United Nations[/url] &amp;amp; [url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm]NATO[/url].


Claim your nation&amp;#39;s territory!  Go to [url=http://i50.tinypic.com/25akdw7.png]Triadelphia&amp;#39;s Map[/url] by clicking on the link.  Rules are:
1. Write the number of the territory you want; first come first serve.
3. One territory per nation.
4. Brightly colored territories will revert over to the territories in darker colors if not claimed.
5. Territorial disputes will be settled by the Triadelphia Association of Nations (TAN) Tribunal.
