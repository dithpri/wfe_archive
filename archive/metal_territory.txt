Welcome to Metal Territory!  This is a Region of Metal Music.  Metal is an eye opening genre, that includes just about every topic imaginable.  Society, politics, law &amp;amp; order, personal relationships, personal problems, religions, drugs and alcohol, addictions, famine, war, death, and even some straight up crazy stuff.  As a subculture, Metal is a very rich, diverse, and unique culture.  We hope to see growth in this page, for those who appreciate Metal, support Metal, and love Metal.
