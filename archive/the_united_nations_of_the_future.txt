Welcome to the UNF! A region of democracy, peace and acceptance of culture and ideologies. In this region, nations of different beliefs and success can work together. The Council of the UNF governs the interaction and relations of the members, and can also bring important regional issues to a discussion. It ensures the smooth operation of the region. 
Any nation that wishes to join will need to message me.
