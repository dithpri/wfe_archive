[i][b][color=rainbow]This is a region based around the ideals of a fair, peaceful and hopefully fun place of residence for a nation. We like to believe that we can offer this as much as possible, and offer platforms to affect the region in positive ways such as [url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=448060]The High Council of the UNF[/url]. Any nation wishing to join us should seek contact with either the acting WA delegate or founder through telegrams or our applications page on our [url=http://officialunf.weebly.com/]website.[/url] [/color][/b][/i]
