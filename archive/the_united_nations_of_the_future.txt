The UNF leaves behind the outdated and unsustainable ideas of  suppression of culture and belief to benefit ones own desires. The UNF gives all an opportunity to develop their nation and success, and cultivate their own future. We use regions such as The Procrastinator Union and TheReformedUnion as examples of how a powerful region can meet its downfall due to the greed of the few and their disregard for the many, and instead look to the many successful regions as examples of how the unity of nations can stand the test of time together. We say farewell to the days of hypocrisy and control, and instead welcome a time of total transparency and acceptance of all ideologies and cultures.
