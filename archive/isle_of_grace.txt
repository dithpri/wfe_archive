Heaven&#39;s Edge stands as the pinnacle of global alliances, commanding unparalleled intellectual strength and scientific leadership. Nations are henceforth invited to join our ranks and contribute to a coalition that sets the standard for innovation and harmonious living. 
At Heaven&#39;s Edge, only qualifying nations will be allowed to stay in order to maintain in-house purity. Repressive and dictatorial nations with tyrannical governments and Human Rights deficiencies will not be allowed- whether politically left or right. Nations with inadequate governance and lawlessness with high degree of crime will not be permitted either. Quality is sought after in this region, not quantity.
