[color=darkred]This region shall stand as a testament to [nation]Tupolite[/nation]/[nation]Umakia[/nation], who was [i]Jerarca[/i] of [region]Nuevo Amanecer[/region], formerly Prime Secretary and [i]de facto[/i] leader of [region]The Iron Confederacy[/region], former First Consul of [region]Libertatem[/region], and former Deputy Minister of Internal Management of [region]Lazarus[/region], as well as briefly editor-in-chief of The Lazarene Gazette (both positions under a false identity as a puppet)... In addition to many other roles I&#39;ve assumed, that should not be made publicly known for the sake of... prudence. I always have a plan in the works, and I am never truly gone no matter what they say...[/color]
