[color=darkred]NICE TRY, [region]Iron Front[/region]![/color]

I came briefly out of retirement to protect the properties which I retain a sentimental attachment towards. How fortuitous that I should have picked this day to check up on things.

[region]Lazarus[/region] may have been a dud. [region]The Pacific[/region] may ride at my heels. [region]The MT Army[/region] may give me conniptions.

But you are no threat to me.
