Cornica is a close, friendly region that enjoys corn and waffles. The nations of Cornica often talk openly amongst each other on the message board and discuss important life questions through polls.
Cornica was founded shortly after World War VII. Many of the countries within Cornica have suffered tragic losses from the terrible conflict, motivating them to band together. Cupcake, our great assassin caterpillar, unfortunately lost one of her legs in the conflict, an event we are still mourning.
Cornica&#39;s regional animal is, traditionally, the cosmic dragon. However, in honor of Cupcake, our regional animals are now both the cosmic dragon and the assassin caterpillar.
CORNICA IS NOT TAKING NEW COUNTRIES UNTIL END OF APOCALYPSE
