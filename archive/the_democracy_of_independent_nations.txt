Together we stand, as individuals of different morals, with similar interests. We, the democratic nations that hereby identify under this pact, believe in the sovereignty of the nation, and thus will not interject into the laws of a state. No matter what they may believe in or practice. All decisions made out of this pact as a whole are democratically decided upon by all members.
