[b]Welcome to the [u]Unification of Alternative Revolutions[/u] which is known as [u]UAR[/u] for short. Our cause seeks to unify various [u]alternative revolutions[/u] which are opposed by the reactionary tyrants behind the current status quo.[/b]

Our goal is to unify nations, groups and people of economically collectivist and socially individualist ideologies and also religious nations, groups and people. Such ideologies include anarchism, leftism from centre-to-far left, environmentalism, pacifism, nationalism, direct democracy, meritocracy, piratism, progressivism, liberalism and libertarianism, be they reformist or radical. Every nation is welcome, as long as they agree with at least one of the aforementioned ideologies.
