The Novus Imperium is a collection of Kingdoms, Duchies, Free Cities, or any other monarchies you can think of. The ruling body is the Congress of Electors, witch vote on an emperor every Thursday. The emperor makes almost all decisions regarding the region, unless in contradiction the Imperial charter, the Constitution of the region. (Not complete yet.) The Empire is very new, and more updates will come.
