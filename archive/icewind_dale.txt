Icewind Dale is an arctic region, along the northernmost part of the Sword Coast.
 
History
The region was first populated when Northlander longships reached the region during the last centuries of the Illefarn empire.

Geography
Icewind Dale was an icy tundra and the northernmost explored area of Faer&ucirc;n. Three lakes, whose temperature even in the summer months is cold enough to kill a man are the only known places to find the Knucklehead trout, a fish whose bones are almost exactly like ivory.

Inhabitants
The region is mainly populated by fishermen, craftsmen, rangers, dwarves, barbarians, and merchants. The region is home to a number of white dragons.
