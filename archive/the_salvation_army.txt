A region risen from the ashes of The Damnation Army, The Salvation Army&#39;s 10 countries are a rag-tag group of polar opposites. While in some areas of the region there are corrupt dictatorships led by massive groups of armed forces and corporate greed there exist parallel states that survive on the whimsical thoughts of equality and freedom. Yet, with all the socio-economic-governmental these countries have managed to band together with the hope that they can bring salvation to the world, despite none of them being religious. The mission of TSA is to nurture intelligence, independence, and creativity in a small regional community, awakening nations to their immense potential and the difference they can make in the world.
