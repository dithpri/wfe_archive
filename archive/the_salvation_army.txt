The Salvation Army is whatever you want it to be.

We are four nations, the last (and the first) who have seen TSA through from its inception, through its peak when it was classified as a &quot;medium&quot; region, to its current condition. Since we have no compelling reason to leave, we will remain, and hope to see it become vibrant once again. Perhaps it will become a liberal paradise. Perhaps it will become a totalitarian wasteland. I, NAND, personally throw in my vote for totalitarian wasteland. But hey. Anything could happen. Join our region, stick around, and you could see it happen first-hand.
