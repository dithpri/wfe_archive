A region founded when four prosperous nations joined together. Their potential to impact the world could not be contained by the previously established regions in NationStates. Thus these founders, The African Alliance, Drevace, Gordians, and Medioka, put forth an effort to produce a region that allowed for the them to reside and to be personally involved with every decision the region made. We wanted a region that was open to all countries and ideas where everyone had a fair say in what went on and everyones opinions would b heard and valued. So this region was created, a group of extraordinary individuals allied for a common cause, A Legion of titans.
