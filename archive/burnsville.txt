 Timothy 2:12 - &quot;I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a male, she must be quiet&quot;

Our McBourt who art in Burns Dorm,
Hallowed be thy name.
Thy boathouse come,
Thy will be done on ergs as it is in Heaven.
Give us this morning workout, our daily morning workout
And forgive us for drawing penises as we forgive those who have trespassed  against us.
Lead us not into the boathouse, but deliver us from the barge.
For thine is the kingdom and the power of McBourt forever.
Amen
