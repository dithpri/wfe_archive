NOTICE: Any embassy proposals from regions tagged as an &quot;Embassy Collector&quot; will be rejected (with some exceptions). This is because our region views embassies as a way of strengthening relations with another region and allowing diplomatic exchanges between ourselves and others. If your region is considering an embassy with The Norwegian Alliance, and is tagged as an &quot;Embassy Collector&quot;, please refrain from this action unless you have a valid reason, in which you can contact [nation]United Jacaria[/nation].
