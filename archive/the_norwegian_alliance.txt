The Norwegian Alliance, despite the name, is a union of European powers willing to open their arms to welcome all who wish to find solace here. May advancement and progression, peace and justice, and the equality of all always hold superiority over all other goals. The Alliance is governed from an international territory collectivity claimed and governed by all members of the Alliance with a permanent population of several hundred thousand. Altogether, however, the Alliance is home to several billion people brought together by the region&#39;s common goal.
