[i]Atlantic City is a seaside resort town in the state of New Jersey. It is commonly referred to as &quot;AC&quot;, &quot;Camden By The Sea&quot; or &quot;Gomorrah With A 3 Drink Minimum And Valet Parking&quot; by the natives. At one time it was a pretty cool place to hang out because entertainers like the Rat Pack and Dizzy Gillespie played there regularly at cool old hotspots with names like the 500 Club and The Harlem Club. But in the 1960s, as Las Vegas gained popularity, the cool factor went west with the entertainers leaving AC a burned-out, rusting, crime-ridden shell.[/i]
