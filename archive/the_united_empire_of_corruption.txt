We are corrupted, and proud of it!

Our Oath of Secrecy:

We, the businessmen of The United Empire of Corruption,
Swear to uphold the Secrets in the business room.
What happens inside there, stays inside there.
And that all Companies shall rise to the height of expansion,
I would not sabotage any of my allies,
Especially my boss [nation]Corrupted Corporations[/nation].
If I or we are found to break this oath of Secrecy,
We shall be ready to face punishment for our wrongdoings.
