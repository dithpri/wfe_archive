the dark dominion, a land rarely traversed by any but the most fearsome of nations. open to any who dare, they only need say &amp;quot;I Submit&amp;quot; 

this region is ruled by the dark lord though rarely commanded by him, for he prefers watching the peons fight for control of the title delegate than to actually dabble in politics himself. though his favor can be earned which may make him inclined to help you gain the title delegate

so...who dares attempt to rule this land?
