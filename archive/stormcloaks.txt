Repeat this oath after me&amp;quot;I fight for the men I&amp;#39;ve held in my arms, dying on foreign soil. I fight for their wives and children, whose names I heard whispered in their last breaths. I fight for we few who did come home, only to find a country full of strangers wearing familiar faces! I fight for my people, impoverished to pay the debts of an Empire too weak to rule them, yet brands them criminals for wanting to rule themselves! I fight so that all the fighting I&amp;#39;ve already done hasn&amp;#39;t been for nothing! I fight because I must. i solemnly swear
