Welcome to the [region]FEMA Camp[/region], a re-education facility. You will do hard work and labor here. All of our embassies are allowed to send their disrespectful residents here to do hard labor. Our prisoners here will do daily hard work and will stay here for 1 week, unless requested otherwise. Liberation of this camp is pointless since this is raid-proof.
