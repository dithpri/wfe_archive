Welcome to the Volunteer Fire Department.
An organization determined to set out the fires of the world both literal and figurative, to keep the world safe.
Our goal is to cater to all nations and treat everyone with specialty and equality. We want to help everyone and provide good company and kindness to all.
The Volunteer Fire Department is set in the Mortmain Mountains.
These Mountains are Cold in the North, Tropical in the East, Arid in the South and relatively Plain in the West. 
We are a community focused on development and discussions, we chat, we support things, we write. We would love to have you here, and every nation will get special attention. It is a place of learning, hobbies and long, flowing conversations.
