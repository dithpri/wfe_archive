After Years of war we have found a place to call our own! We have been oppressed and will continue to be, but as along as we have hope, WE WILL LIVE ON!!! It is known that we are a dying kind that is being hunted down and poisoned, then left for dead. With this new found land We will rebuild from the ashes and keep out the darkness that keeps pressing in on us. So as we have always said, NEVER GIVE UP, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS!!!
