The Armed Empire of Mithriel is a loyal, just and strong alliance of nations that want to unite the world, improve it and take back culture. The philosophy of equality, freedom and fraternity embodies the eagle, the national animal that flies over the swampy flat, rugged and beautiful mountains and breathtaking coasts of our earth.

We will unite in this region the strength of the Romans, the religion and the nature of the Japanese, the communism and capitalism and the values of the French Revolution to make people happy.
