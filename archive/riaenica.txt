Continent that once housed the Great Riane (Riaene) Empire and her colonies. After generations of civil war, national liberation movements, and revolution, the continent has settled. We have no particular story above collaboration. The largest nation is the Rianavian Confederation, made up of a loose union of states around the Riane River, the River that splits the continent down the middle.
