The Confederation of Liberation and Revolution (CLR) is a region with an anarchist ideology (both egoist and communist) that aims to establish a horizontally and decentrally organized coalition of nations to challenge the establishment.

This region has limited communitarian regulation, purely based on maintaining a healthy and respectful environment and avoiding infiltration and &quot;esquiroles&quot;.

Our borders are completely open to anyone who does not violate our fundamental principles, as we oppose any limitation of freedoms (including freedom of movement).

Ask by telegram to a delegate for access to our Discord server, where we do all the decision-making. We call it the Free Soviet.
