[region]Circumstella[/region] is the name the interstellar colonists gave to what astronomers call &amp;#39;the Local Bubble&amp;#39;. It is a cavity in the interstellar medium (ISM) in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way that contains, among others, the Local Interstellar Cloud, G-cloud, and the Solar System. It is at least 300 light years across and has a neutral-hydrogen density of about 0.05 atoms/cm3, or approximately one tenth of the average for the ISM in the Milky Way (0.5 atoms/cm3), and one sixth of the Local Interstellar Cloud (0.3 atoms/cm3). The hot diffuse gas in the Local Bubble emits X-rays.

The stars in the flag of Circumstella represent Alpha Centauri A and B, Sol, Sirius A and B, Procyon and Tau Ceti.
