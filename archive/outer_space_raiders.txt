We raid small regions that are becoming a raiding problem (e.g. taking over other nations maliciously, etc.).

We have no direct leader, as the nations in the region can change anything.  They just have to vote.

Use the message board to vote.

Notes on joining:
You do not have to be in the WA to join; however, you are highly encouraged to do so.
