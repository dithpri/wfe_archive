Welcome to Swanktown! This the the world&#39;s premier region for all things swank. This is a humble community with few members, but were like family. We treat each other &amp; all others with respect. If you are lucky enough to find yourself in our ranks, you must do the same.

Embassies always accepted


I don&#146;t know why, but we like our color scheme of black, red, and white.
