Rygel, officially known as the Greater Rygelius Area, was once a continent spanned by  a single empire known as the Rygelian Empire. Following the Great Rygelian War,  the Rygelian Empire split into five nation-states and the mostly-irradiated borderlands of Outer Rygelius.

The majority of Rygel&amp;#39;s economic and political power is concentrated in the central state, Rygelius. The other nations with the exception of the loosely-governed and near-anarchic borderlands, however, are mostly autonomous in their own governance.
