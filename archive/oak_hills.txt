[You walk into a destroyed region and see a sign]
LEAVE NOW WHILE YOU STILL CAN.

A Note is also attached 

The Region is now a War-torn desolate husk of what it once was. The War destroyed everything. The founding nations have either fallen or departed the region. The Confederation controls what little is left. There is nothing here for you.
