[u][b]Oak Hills[/b][/u]

A Large Expansive Region of Former Southern California made up various ideologically diverse Nation States. Our Countries vary from  Right-Wing Capitalist Republics, Liberal Left-Wing Democracies, and various Dictatorships both Leftist and Fascist.  

We stand as a focal point of good morals and plan to stay the side of the World Council as dutiful member states of the world regions.

Although small, we are strong in numbers and have great minds amongst us.

Oak Hills is an open community of members from Southern California, all others that attempt to join and or invade region will receive the full force of Oak Hills strength.

We look forward to the future, happy Nation building.
