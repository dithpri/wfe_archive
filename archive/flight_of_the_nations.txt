We just want to do something special for all the ladies in the world. If all the soldiers in the world put down their weapons and picked up a woman, think what a peaceful world this world could be. It&amp;#39;s gotta be sweet sixteens not M16&amp;#39;s. Redheads, not warheads. Blondes, not bombs. Talking about brunettes, not fighter jets.
