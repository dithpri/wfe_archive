[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to ask themselves a very important question. 

What is a finger? What were these mysterious objects used for? [color=blue]Were they only good at feeling cold?[/color]

We decided to visit your region to collect some fingers and experiment with them. Along the way, we saw found [color=orange]fish fingers, onion fingers and your fingers.[/color] 

We poked the fingers at the [color=black]undead abyss[/color] of hoping that someone on the other side might respond. Sadly, no one did, and we went off without adding anything to our collection of fingers.
