Surprise!!!! You&acute;ve been raided by the chaos crew (really it was the ERN but who&acute;s counting). We come tonight to offer our greetings and well wishes but mostly we want to shame [nation]Vorhollah[/nation] for being asleep. We are in fact so disappointed that we won&acute;t even ask [nation]grandfather_clock[/nation] to rejoin the ERN out of spite.

And now for something completely different: 

We ride through the night
Our ships fueled by sluggish might
We burst through every tight locked door
But mostly we&acute;re just missing
Vor.
