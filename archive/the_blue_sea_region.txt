     The Blue Sea Region is the designation given to the various smaller regions that are made up of the nations bordering and around the frigid waters of the Blue Sea, an ocean in close proximity to the Green Sea. While a majority of the Blue Sea Region has long and harsh winters, there are various landscapes which greatly diversify the region, such as the badlands of Janka, the Highlands of Alba, and the lush meadows of Arnyr. World Assembly dignitaries and declarations are not recognized by the Blue Sea Region as a whole, although some nations actively participate.
