Hello and Welcome to the Blue Sea Region!

We now have a Region News Forum, since the message board for NS doesn&amp;#39;t meet our needs. Go to the following link to sign up for it, and PM the administrator (Kowalski) for admin privileges in your board. [url=http://bsrnews.boards.net/]Region News Forum[/url]

We also have a regional map. If you aren&amp;#39;t on here, contact Pintegorsk about being placed.
