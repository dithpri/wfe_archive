Welcome to Europea! We are a nice, fine, recently founded region based on a blank map of Europe, West Asia and North Africa.

We are a password-protected region. To enter the region, you must TG [nation]Snowiny[/nation] with a long message stating why you want to join our region (&amp;quot;can i join region pls? i just need a region and i feel like yours is good&amp;quot; is not acceptable). This password-protection is in light because of a recent invasion by foreign forces. You will be told the password if you are accepted into the region; but the password will change every 3 days. Residents won&amp;#39;t be told when it changes and what the new password is.
