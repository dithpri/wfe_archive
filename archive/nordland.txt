Nordland is a large continent in the Northern Hemisphere of the World. It&#39;s been an on and off project of mine for years. Unfortunately I&#39;m very busy. I have created multiple nations in Nordland and many fiction stories based around it&#39;s countries.

Anyway, Nordland is governed as a whole by the Nordland Tribunal which started as a regional court for cross border crimes. It had evolved into a sort of European Union which guaranteed international diplomacy not matter what nation was fighting the other. Because not all Nordland Nations have embassies in every nation Nordland as a whole has an embassy in every world wide region.
