[color=red][b]Welcome to the Crab port! [/b][/color]

A British port nestled in an archipelago in the Caribbean. It is an important crossing point between America and Europe. 

The region has repeatedly been attacked in vain by hordes of lawless pirate raiders, but don&#39;t worry, their bodies are lying at the end of a rope or languishing in a cell in the fort. 

Don&#39;t hesitate to peek at the long list of miserable forbands who have tried in vain to occupy the region. 

[color=red] [b]By decree of the British crown, all aggressive pirates and raiders will be hanged[/b][/color]
