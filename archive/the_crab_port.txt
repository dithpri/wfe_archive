[color=blue][b]Welcome to The Crab Port! [/b][/color]

Nestled on an islet in the Caribbean, the Crab Port is a must for ships leaving or heading to the United States.

Strengthened by its fortress with a thousand cannons and protected for a long time by its Majesty&#39;s navy.

The port is constantly fighting against raids by buccaneers, raiders, pirates and other menacing brigands from the seas. If you&#39;re looking for trouble the governor warns you&#39;ll end up at the end of a rope.
