[color=yellow][b]Welcome to The Crab Port! [/b][/color]

Nestled in a Caribbean archipelago, the Crab Port is a British colony and a necessary passage between Europe and the United States. 

Often attacked by pirates, forbands, raiders, brigands and other threats, the port has always resisted futile attempts to take over the place.
