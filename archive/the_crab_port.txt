A tropical island in the Caribbean under British rule. The port sees many boats, from small fishing vessels to large military galions. 

The port is also a mysterious place where a thousand and one stories are told around the corner of an inn. 

Repeatedly attacked by pirates, brigands and other raiding mobsters, the region holds its own and hangs high and runs the enemies.
