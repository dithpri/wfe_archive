We are [b][i]the[/i][/b] region that seeks freedom from the [b]tyranny[/b] the establishment regions. 

A region that promotes [i]laissez-faire[/i], we seek no recruiting, and our region is all about the casual game-play. 

You can do more if you&#39;d like, [b][u]but[/b][/u] you&#39;re not likely to find anyone that takes this too seriously.

[b]Come and go as you please![/b]
