A place for nations and regions to initiate diplomatic talks with each other on this Regional Message Board or by sending representatives into the region for more face to face meetings.. 
Integrate the region with your role-playing needs as a neutral table.
Think of this table as a different form of World Assembly (that doesn&#39;t enforce WA policies on nations), which mainly provide a diplomatic forum for discussion of issues, treaties etc. Useful if your normal embassy got closed due to war, have meeting here with representatives from both sides or having both link embassies.
Try to keep the mud-slinging minimal, in consideration of cleaning crews (that need moderate/filter swear words).
Any Embassies and representatives of regions welcome.
