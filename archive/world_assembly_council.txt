A place for all nations and regions to discuss their issues with each other, diplomatically.. via discussion on the Regional Message Board (should have posting permission via embassies) or sending representatives for more face to face meetings..
Try to keep the mud-slinging minimal, in consideration of cleaning crews.
Think of this as a different form of world assembly, one that doesn&#39;t enforce laws upon members like WA, yet still provide a diplomatic table/forum for discussion of issues between nations.
All Embassies Welcome.
