A place for all nations and regions to discuss their issues with each other diplomatically.. via discussion on the Regional Message Board or by sending representatives into the region for more face to face meetings.. Integrate the region with your role-playing as a neutral table.
Try to keep the mud-slinging minimal, in consideration of cleaning crews. (that need moderate/filter swear words and such)
Think of this as a different form of World Assembly, one that doesn&#39;t enforce laws upon members like WA, only provide a diplomatic table/forum for discussion of issues between nations. 
All Embassies Welcome. 
Please can representatives leave region when your meeting is over/concluded - these seats are not meant to be personal living quarters.
