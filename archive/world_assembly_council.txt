A place for all nations and regions to discuss their issues with each other, diplomatically.. via discussion on the Regional Message Board or sending representatives.
Try to keep the mud-slinging minimal, in consideration of cleaning crews.
Think of this as a different form of world assembly, one that doesn&#39;t enforce laws upon members, yet still provide a diplomatic table/forum for discussion of issues between nations.
All Embassies Welcome.
