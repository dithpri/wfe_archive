[color=brown][u][B]Welcome to &#39;The Fuel of the Ages!&#39;[/B][/u]
In this alternate history, we explore the idea of a pseudo cold war between dieselpunk and steampunk, where technology is is so similar yet so very different from our age. Nations fight over which fuel is better, while some try to find a middle ground of both. Soldiers still fight in trenches, but under the battling Airships, for example. So please, fill out your Entry Application and once approved, settle down for some roleplay with other nations.
