[b][color=gold]Chanukkah also known as Hanukkah is a holiday celebrated by the Jewish People to celebrate the Maccabees&#39; victory against the Seleucid Empire. When the Maccabees retook the Second Temple and wanted to light its Menorah, they realized they only had enough oil for one day. However, by some miracle the oil lasted for eight days![/color][/b]
