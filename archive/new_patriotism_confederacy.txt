The patriotism this Confederacy needs is clear-eyed, though-minded and unafraid. It remembers that &#39;America the Beautiful&#39; asks God not just to &#39;shed His Grace on thee&#39; but to &#39;mend thine every flaw&#39;. It reveres our freedom so much that it seeks to ensure those freedoms to everyone of our citizens, of every race and creed. It recognizes the patriots in uniform who stand on the watchtowers of freedom.
