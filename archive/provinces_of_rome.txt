[color=#6e2dac][b]This region has been struck by the blades of [region]the Brotherhood of Malice[/region]. A brotherhood is only as good as its weakest member. Thus, for tonight, our brothers helped teach and guide our young initiates. Like how to write grafitti or burning math books.

If you want to be part of the Brotherhood, why not join us at our [url=https://discord.gg/U3vZX6hPzc]regional Discord![/url][/color]
