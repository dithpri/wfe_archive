This union is a loose grouping of similar minded states who wish to promote freedoms, civil rights, and capitalist like economies across the world. We work together to ensure a free and fair world. 

All roles and ideas are democratically elected, and elections will be held once more member states join the region. Initially, [nation]The Dutch Citizens[/nation] will hold the role of interim leader, until an election can be held. As a result, could all member states please endorse The Dutch Citizens.
