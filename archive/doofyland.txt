
Welcome to the region of **Doofyland**, a coalition of nations bound by shared values of militarism, corporate control, and state-enforced obedience. In Doofyland, governments are efficient and ruthless, prioritizing defense, industry, and loyalty while dismissing spirituality, protests, and environmental concerns as distractions. Citizens are expected to consume, conform, and comply&#151;freedom exists, but only in ways that benefit the state. Education serves the system, the poor sell their organs to get ahead, and the air is thick with both smog and ambition. United under a banner of order and profit, the nations of Doofyland march boldly into a future where power is streamlined, dissent is quietly erased, and progress never asks permission.
