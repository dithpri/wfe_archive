It has been two years since the total destruction of the region Erheben. Survivors were left without a home, and had to seek out greater, more promising lands. A group of survivors comprised of citizens of many different Erhebenic countries banded together in the search for a new home. Finally, after two years, they stumbled upon this great region, and claimed it as New Erheben.
