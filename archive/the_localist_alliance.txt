The Localist Alliance is a group of nations that support local production and consumption of goods, local control of government, and promotion of local history, local culture and local identity. Nations of the Alliance advocates for organising national government so that local autonomy is retained, with central authority retaining only a subsidiary function, performing only those tasks which cannot be performed at a more local level.

&quot;Instead of growth serving life, life now serves growth, perverting the very purpose of existence.&quot;
