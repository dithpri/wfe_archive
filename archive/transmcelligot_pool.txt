[b]TransMcElligot Pool (aka TransMcElligot Spartz, TransMcElligot Rawr, TMEP, or simply &amp;quot;The Pool&amp;quot;) - [color=#db0000]This region was used as a defender jump point from April 4, 2011 to February 11, 2012, when the update order was shuffled. Coincidentally, the founder switched to the raider side 4 days earlier, on his NS wife&amp;#39;s birthday (love you, [nation=short]Tramiar[/nation]!).[/color]

[color=#927519]The Pool was formerly the second latest updating region, though later on it was pushed back to fourth. It served the FRA, and later on the UDL, peaking at around 250 switchers in mid-January. After Spartz switched, and update order was changed, they moved to [region]Andros[/region] (and soon after, [region]Kyzikos[/region]).[/color]

[color=#800000]This region now serves as a memorial to that era.[/color][/b]
