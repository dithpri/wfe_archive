[b]The Conservative Nations Assembly[/b]

The CNA is a casual region for any type of conservative. The Region is brand new and will have democratic elections for the position of WA delegate. Me (Cavino) will retain all powers for life along side the Delegate, for security reasons. All sounds very corrupt but I promise, it&#146;s not.

More coming soon.
