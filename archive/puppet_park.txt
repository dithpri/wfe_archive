[COLOR=GREEN][b]PUPPET PARK IS CLOSED FOR BUSINESS[/b]

It was a nice long run for over 5 years but now it must end. I have password protected the region to dissuade any further immigration. I will leave this message up for a good period of time and then any remaining residents will gently, and with my gratitude, be ushered into their new home in [b][region]The Rejected Realms[/region][/b] and Puppet Park will vanish with a *POOF*. Myself, I have already retired to [b][region]Magic Eight Ball[/region][/b], content to let their RNG do all the work. So goodbye, and thanks for all the fish...
