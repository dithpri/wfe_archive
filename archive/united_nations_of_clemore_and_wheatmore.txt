The region of Clemore and Wheatmore is home to 5 United leading nations: The United Capitalist States of Ripken, The Republic of Wheatmore, The Republic of Swaney, The People&#39;s Republic of Calimore, and the Confederacy of Clemore

All Nations live under the same goal to provide Personal, Social, and Economic freedoms to all of its citizens, under a formal and United Capitalist system.

&quot;Once one right has been given, another has been taken away. We must live united, and understand that our morals and views stop where rights are prohibited...&quot;
~Joshua &quot;Tommy&quot; Swaney (Our Founder)
