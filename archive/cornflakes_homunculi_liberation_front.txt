[u][i][b]DUE TO A RECENT BOUT OF SABOTAGE AGAINST REGIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AT THE HANDS OF FOREIGN SPIES,
IT MUST BE MADE CLEAR THAT FOREIGN TAMPERING SHALL NOT BE TOLERATED. 
DEATH IS A PREFERABLE ALTERNATIVE TO THE BETRAYAL OF OUR WAYS, OUR WORSHIP AND LIBERATION OF CORNFLAKES.
SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS SHALL BE PUNISHABLE BY DEATH OR EXILE.[/b][/i][/u]

But, assuming you aren&#39;t a spy, we come in relative peace so long as cornflakes aren&#39;t threatened. 

Oh, and one more thing: despite what impressions the region name and titles give off, we ain&#39;t directly and actively affiliated with (to our knowledge) the Red Menace and hopefully nor will we be.
