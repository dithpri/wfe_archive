DUE TO A RECENT BOUT OF SABOTAGE AGAINST REGIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AT THE HANDS OF FOREIGN SPIES,
IT MUST BE MADE CLEAR THAT FOREIGN TAMPERING SHALL NOT BE TOLERATED. 
DEATH IS A PREFERABLE ALTERNATIVE TO THE BETRAYAL OF OUR WAYS, OUR WORSHIP AND LIBERATION OF CORNFLAKES.
SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS SHALL BE PUNISHABLE BY DEATH OR EXILE.

But, assuming you aren&#39;t a spy, we come in relative peace so long as cornflakes aren&#39;t threatened.
