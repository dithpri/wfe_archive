The Indomitable Nations are a relatively new coalition, formed due to the harsh world the nation states inhabit. Though their ideologies differ radically, they have the same goals in mind. Growth and influence are what they desire, and glory and sense are what they have. The formation of the IN came about when the Chadwickian Empire began to rapidly expand, endangering all those around them. Those nations, now the nations of this coalition, defeated the Chadwickians and partitioned the land between them. Now they strive for more power, more influence, more glory. The Indomitables will forever push into new frontiers.
