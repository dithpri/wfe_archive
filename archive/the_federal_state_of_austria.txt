[color=Red]The Federal State of Austria (Austrian German: Bundesstaat &Ouml;sterreich ; colloquially known as the St&auml;ndestaat, &amp;quot;Corporate State&amp;quot;) refers to Austria between 1934 and 1938 while it was a single-party state led by the clerico-fascist Fatherland&amp;#39;s Front. The St&auml;ndestaat concept, derived from the notion of St&auml;nde (&amp;quot;estates&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;corporations&amp;quot;), was propaganda advocated by leading politicians such as Engelbert Dollfu&szlig; and Kurt Schuschnigg. The result was an authoritarian government based on a mix of conservative Catholic and Italian Fascist influences.[/color]
