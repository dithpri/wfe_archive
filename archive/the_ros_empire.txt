[i]The Ros Empire[/i] was prosecuted by the [region]Imperial Japanese Navy[/region] in June of 2019, in punishment of war crimes committed against [region]Warzone Africa[/region]. Warzone Africa is a region which, by treaty between then native delegate [nation]Hong Kaong[/nation] and the [b]Admiral of the Japanese fleet[/b], is allied with the [i]Imperial Japanese Navy[/i], and which the IJN is obligated to defend.

The founder of The Ros Empire, [i]King Gemmel I of [nation]A rosa[/nation][/i], was found guilty in a military tribunal, and executed. Several officers of The Ros Empire&#39;s armed forces were also found guilty, and executed, as well. 

The Imperial Japanese Navy would like this region to stand as a warning to future war criminals, who might try and attack allies of the IJN, in violation of international law.
