Long ago, there was a place where all fruit could live together in peace and harmony. But that all changed when the vegetables attacked. Only the Papaya, master of all healthy nourishment could bring them together, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed and Pear and my brother Apple have discovered the new Papaya. And although his fruit-bending skills are great, Papaya has a lot to learn before he&amp;#39;s ready to save anyone. But I believe, Papaya can save the world.
