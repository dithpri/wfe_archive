Oh hello there! 

Welcome to the Bewitched Forest, filled with haunting trees, necromancers driven to insanity by the creatures of the forest &amp; large lakes filled with mysterious &amp; deadly creatures and plants.

Despite our haunting landscape, we aren&#39;t so bad, The Bewitched Forest is a small collection of nations on a foggy island far away. We hope you enjoy staying here and discovering what&#39;s in those lakes, haha.
