First discovered in 849 OG (Regional calendar-wise), it was mostly overlooked at first, then in 1068 OG some of the leaders from The Pacific Regions agreed to colonize the land, but they found a small issue - there were no good names left to give the area. So they named it The Region Region and thus the mass colonization of the area begun. Then, in 1299 OG there was &amp;quot;The Great Regional War&amp;quot; in which mass-murder of innocent people by troops was common. The war only accomplished the complete destruction of every colony. Now, the area is being re-colonized and hopefully the peace that came after &amp;quot;The Great Regional War&amp;quot; -if you can call it that- is maintained by the new nations and colonies that are in This Region.
