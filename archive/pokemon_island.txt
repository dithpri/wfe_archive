Originally and uninhabited island, Pokemon Island was purchased by Professor Oak in 1996. The island was stocked with pokemon and in 1999 was opened up as a tourist resort, of sorts. Now it is one of the premier destinations for vacations from people across all pokemon regions, being one of the few places in the world that can boast a population of every known pokemon.
