Located off the coast of Kanto; Pokemon Island is a resort destination owned and operated by Professor Oak. Initially used as a pokemon preserve and observatory the Professor, working with other regional Professor&#39;s from around the pokemon world, has stocked the island with almost every known species of pokemon using the unique biomes of the island to observe how pokemon who would never meet naturally react to each other. Recently the professor has chosen to open the island up to trainers and tourists who wish to experience the unique opportunities that Pokemon Island offers.
