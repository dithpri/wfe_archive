Hi ! Welcome in the TSC. It&#39;s been created to unite all the democratic countries which promote civil rights and pacifism. Don&#39;t worry, if your country isn&#39;t socialist, you still can join our organization, but you have to be democratic (at least).

Our objective is not complicated : we want to build a country&#39;s community which highlights civil rights but also justice and economy, to create a society where all the citizens are free to do what they want as long as they respect the organization&#39;s fundamental rules. We also want to include people from others political orientations, to create the perfect combinaison of socialism and others ideologies... 

It would be a great pleasure to have you in this project :)
