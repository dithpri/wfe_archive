Danu Talis is a large ancient continent once inhabited by massive beings. Man has existed on Danu Talis for only a dozen generations. The massive beings are not known and nothing is known about them other than buildings they left behind. Then came the Earthlords who ruled over for many generations before the Archons who were massive beings that were technologically advanced more so than the races before.
