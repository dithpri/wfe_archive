[B]Last night the leaders of [region]New Reich of Bunicken[/region] and the [region]Raxulan Empire[/region] were out making sure people were social distancing, spraying things down with sanitizer and handing out fliers asking if anyone had seen [region]The Black Hawks[/region] beloved bot Penny.

It was then that we spotted a region that was infected by the worst disease of all! [Url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killings_under_communist_regimes]COMMUNISM.[/url]

Apon seeing this pitiful sight we took it apon ourselves to come in to cure and sanitize this unfortunate region.
