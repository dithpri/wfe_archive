This region was founded, obviously, by a neo-Nazi, possibly because the region name &amp;quot;National Socialist Movement&amp;quot; had already been taken. It was then refounded by an unknown person, probably someone opposed to Nazism. It has now been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b].

R.I.P. victims of ethnocentrism.
