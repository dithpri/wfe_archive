
The Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula comprises a significant proportion of the ancient Maya Lowlands (although the Maya culture extended south of the Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula, through present Guatemala and into Honduras and highland Chiapas). There are many Maya archaeological sites throughout the peninsula; some of the better-known are Chichen Itza, Tulum and Uxmal.[3] Indigenous Maya and Mestizos of partial Maya descent make up a sizable portion of the region&#39;s population, and Mayan languages are widely spoken there.
