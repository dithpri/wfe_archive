[b]Welcome to the Obsidian Realm![/b]

The Obsidian Realm is a region set in a medieval setting and largely incorporates fantasy and magic themes. 

In the future, nations can apply as a feudal kingdom, stronghold, or village, and get a spot on the Obsidian Realm&#39;s official map through dispatches that will be published onto the region. An official index will be made on nations officially recognized as part of the Obsidian Realm&#39;s lore and map. Additionally, there are plans for mechanics which allow for nations to invade, trade, or make agreements between them.
