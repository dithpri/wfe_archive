The pact of Sargatha was originally formed by three nations. These three galactic nations understood the need of co-operation if they were to become strong. For thousands of years these three became more powerful, and as they did so they began adopting there own ways of life. The empire of Kelt Trazia, one of the more peace loving nations has recently migrated from the territory and thus left the pact. Now completely controlled by the more aggressive governments of Kadaar and Voivogatharia, the pact that these two hold now has begun massive expansion of territorial claims.
