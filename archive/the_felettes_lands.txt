The Felettes(fill-et-esh) Lands were discovered only a few miles off the coast of The Empire of Ater Nox by explorers from The Matriarchy of Hangro. The Felettes lands were large and inhabited only by a small civilized tribe known as the &amp;#39;csikl&oacute;&amp;#39; (cheek-loo). The Felettes Lands were bountiful with fruits, minerals, fresh water, and stable soil for building. Hangro set up small camps on the shore of the beautiful violet sand beaches of The Felettes Lands and began building more and more on it&amp;#39;s rich soils. Today, The Matriarchy of Hangro thrives on The Felettes Lands and has even began to expand its region in order to recruit other peaceful nations much like itself.
