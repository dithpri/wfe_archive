[b]Romulan Neutral Zone[/b]

The Romulan Neutral Zone is a vast, heavily fortified boundary between the Romulan Star Empire and the United Federation of Planets. Established as a buffer zone to prevent conflict between the two powers, the Neutral Zone is strictly off-limits to unauthorized starships from either side. It is constantly patrolled by warbirds from the Romulan Imperial Fleet, and any incursion into the zone is considered an act of war.
