FPTO was founded as as a military and economic cooperative between the nationstates of Florida&#39;s peninsula in a spirit of mutual friendship. It&#39;s two main objectives are shared prosperity amongst the members and common military defense. While cultural and social differences prevented the different regions of Florida from uniting as a single country following the collapse of America in 2021, FPTO united them in sharing a common future together.
