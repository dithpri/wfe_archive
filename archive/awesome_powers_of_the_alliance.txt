(Abbreviated to APOTA)

This alliance is between countries with close relations. When you accept an invitation you will be given a password but you must keep it for yourself. We also welcome weak nations for their protection and support. Stronger countries that want to join will have to become well associated with the admin (Look up: Grand Duchy of Athela).

This alliance is about looking out for each other and so members are expected to help one another as well as the entire alliance in times of need. We are generally peaceful but will defend ourselves if we have to.
