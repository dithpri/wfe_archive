The Germanic Confederation is an association of Germanic countries that is committed to safeguarding the sovereignty of it&amp;#39;s members. We at the Germanic Confederation wholeheartedly agree with the principles of self determination for all peoples. We welcome those of all ethnicities, religions, and creeds provided they are not either communist nor fascist. Our confederation is strictly Pacifist in its views and we hope to become a center of peaceful collaboration between all nations.
