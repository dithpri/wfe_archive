The Germanic Confederation is an association of Germanic countries that is committed to safeguarding the independence of it&amp;#39;s members. The legislative body consists of the Diet which is composed of all members of the confederation. The leader of the Diet is the Speaker of the Diet who organizes the process of the Diet. There are two executive positions in the Confederation. The Elector is the hereditary position which is a figurehead with the exception of being the representative to the security council. The Chancellor who is elected by the Diet does most of the day to day business of the Confederation. The Chief Justice of the supreme court is responsible for mediating disputes between members.
