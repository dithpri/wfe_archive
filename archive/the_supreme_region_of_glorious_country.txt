Tired of being spammed to join new regions, Glorious Country sunk itself into the ocean, and then rose up again somewhere random. It then isolated itself from the rest of the world, and is NOT accepting your embassies or requests to join.

This state is home to only the most pristine of wildlife, with millions (if not billions) of endemic species. Examples of such include the Potato, the national animal of Glorious Country.
