Welcome to the greatest Empire that the world has ever known. In the year 2030, faced with widespread resource shortages and lack of oil, India made a bold decision--to conquer the petroleum-rich regions of the world and create a great Imperium. Now, with the control of much of the world&amp;#39;s resources, and with the aid of new energy technology, India&amp;#39;s economy is good once again. Our control stretches throughout much of the world, and the Earth slaves in fear of our Power. We urge you to join the Empire.
