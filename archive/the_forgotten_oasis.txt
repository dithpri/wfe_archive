 When the people living under the oppressive rule Moammar Suresh fled, they knew they would be chased. So they fled to the one place Moammar could not follow them: the scorching heat and blistering winds of the Tabula Rasa Desert. What they did not expect was to find a large oasis at the center of the desert. They claimed the land for all people who wish to be free of oppression, as well as the inherent corruption of capitalism that made Moammar&amp;#39;s rise possible in the first place. The people founded Veracistan, and though others have since flocked to the desert hideaway, Veracistan was the first to find it, and have been quietly revealing it&amp;#39;s existence to freedom fighters and dissatisfied rebels around the world.
