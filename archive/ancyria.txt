[b]Welcome to the world of [color=gold]Ancyria[/color]![/b]

The brainchild of [nation=short]qamadan[/nation] (a.k.a. [nation=short]faransia[/nation], [nation=short]conpatraia[/nation], [nation=short]neisonia[/nation], [nation=short]al-djezer[/nation], and [nation=short]kithomer[/nation], Ancyria will be a region focused on information. Nations without a developed factbook/wiki will not be allowed, and nations must ask Qamadan&amp;#39;s permission to stay. If you are a member of [region]Noctur[/region], consider yourself welcome.

Also a puppet stash. Just make sure those puppets are also developed.
