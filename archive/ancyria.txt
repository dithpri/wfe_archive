[b]Welcome to the world of [color=gold]Ancyria[/color]![/b]

The brainchild of [nation=short]qamadan[/nation], Ancyria will be a region focused on information. Nations without a developed factbook/wiki will not be allowed, and nations must ask Qamadan&amp;#39;s permission to stay.

Also a puppet stash. Just make sure those puppets are also developed.

A colony of [region]Noctur[/region] and funded by the Rothana Heavy Engineering Corporation.
