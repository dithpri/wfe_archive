Welcome to our new American haven, The United States of Independence Hill. There&#39;s much to do and we need many Nation States to do help bask in the freedom of New America. We cut ties with our Mother Land because of corruption, violence, and greed. We value the constitution of our Mother Land but do not like its rigidity. We have adopted this constitution and hopefully we can get it ratified by the present and future States. Lots of positions to fill.
