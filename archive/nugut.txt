Senator: But Jove, you ordered no triumphs!
Caligula: Well, of course I ordered no triumphs, do you think I&amp;#39;d ordered triumphs for myself?!
Senator: But you ordered us not to order any!
Caligula: Yessssss, and you took me at my word, didn&amp;#39;t you? Typical! It didn&#146;t occur to you that I might be leaving it up to you for your love to show itself freely; didn&amp;#39;t occur to you that it might be my natural humility speaking!
