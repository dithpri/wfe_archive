The aim of The Cult of Sharing (formerly The Gift of Gi/v/ing) is to provide an entertaining, relaxed, and active chat while being a platform for trading and occasionally giving. If you&amp;#39;re new, contact one of the officers or get your friend to contact us. You&amp;#39;ll enjoy the atmosphere, trust me.
