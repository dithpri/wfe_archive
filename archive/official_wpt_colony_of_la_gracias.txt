The region of La Gracias, a colony discovered by a nation called the Western Pacific Territories. The land is shared by Azenyanistan and the Federation of Democratic Regions. While there may be disputes, and censorship in this region (Take that from a literal standpoint or a RP standpoint.), it is relativly peaceful here.
