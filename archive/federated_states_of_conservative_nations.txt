The Federated States of Conservative Nations is a place for Conservatives to profess their views and to not be suppressed by certain people. Political discourse and discussion is welcome and encouraged, but if you get offended don&#39;t cry to the regional admins about it. The complaint department doesn&#39;t exist. The region also hold democratic elections.
