The Federated States of Conservative Nations[/region] is a place for Conservatives and allies of conservatives to profess their views and to not be suppressed by certain people. Political discourse and discussion is welcome and encouraged, but if you get offended don&#39;t cry to the regional admins about it. The complaint department doesn&#39;t exist. The region holds democratic elections once a year for admin jobs.
