Front Line is the location of the battleground between the armies of the Fourth Reichs and the Red Line. It is evident that war has been waged at that location for quite some time; shell casings litter the ground and burnt-out vehicles are numerous. Motivation for the battle is unknown, although it is probably because of contrasting ideals between the two factions, or because this area represents a significant tactical advantage to both sides.
