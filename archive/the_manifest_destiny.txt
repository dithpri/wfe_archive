FOUNDED: DECEMBER 3, 2013

Unfortunately, the [i][b][color=Orange]Manifest Destiny[[/color][/b][/i] was once a thriving, colorful, and RP filled region. 

After several members left, including a few founding members, the region hit a area of inactivity. 

Following this, several new nations joined and the region was again thriving, until [b]The Black Riders[/b] Raided the region under the a disguise.

Several other raids by various groups have entered a new period of decline and inactivity. Which is present day.
