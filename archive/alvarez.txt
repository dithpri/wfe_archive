[color=blue]Welcome to the 8th Age of Alvarez: [i]The Age of the Young Guns.[/i]

Alvarez is a highly competitive, dynamic region with frequent elections and six guilds all ruthlessly competing to elect one of their own as Grand Chancellor.  Change happens fast and frequent as new coalitions are formed, Guilds are created and disbanded, and the citizens are always planning their next move toward the ultimate prize.  Become a citizen, join a Guild, and begin your quest to the top.
