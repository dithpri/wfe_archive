The Christian Confederation is a Nondenominational Christian intergovernmental region dedicated to an alliance of nations who govern according to the principalities of the Bible and teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ. The Christian Confederation allows each member state to govern itself, but we unite as an alliance to serve a bigger purpose of running our government, laws, and other aspects of our state under the divine and holy authority of our Lord God.
