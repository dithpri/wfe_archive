This is a place for film lovers, filmmakers, basically anyone who is super passionate about the art of film. We discuss all things film, and are pretty open- minded about what you like, as long as you can explain it well. This is a thinking, contemplative region, where we will have long discussion on &amp;quot;meaningless topics,&amp;quot; like the use of three- dimensional space in Stanley Kubrick films. 

Again, if you love anything to do with film, if you are deeply passionate about it, come on down. And if this entry makes you laugh, then all I can say is, &amp;quot;Tell me, tell me what&amp;#39;s funny!&amp;quot;
