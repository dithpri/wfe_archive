Welcome to Dark Ages! This region is mainly focused on realistic roleplaying through the nationstates ++  newspaper function. Each article will be like a update for what your region is doing. The setting is during the high middle ages and you can become whomever you&#39;d like to be (real or not). Holy figures such as Caliphs and Popes can call holy wars. Not to mention, you can war against whomever you&#39;d like, but be sure to be realistic and use of stats through the nationstates stats-thing (i&#39;ll post a link later) to determine the winner of wars. Forge a kingdom history will remember, you rulers of old, Farewell.
