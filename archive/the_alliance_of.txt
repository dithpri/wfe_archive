[region]The Alliance Of[/region] is a region and political allegiance, founded by [nation]The Beanlands[/nation], to establish trade, collaborate and offer mutual protection.

We share a fearsome army, dedicated to protection of the region from hostility, invasions to further the region&#39;s Imperium, and other military operations. An attack against one member is an attack against all! We also collaborate to better develop the region overall, and recruit new nations to join! Finally, we have a Regional Senate - nations given a &#39;Senator&#39; rank or officers are part of The Senate, who govern our region!

All this region&#39;s members must abide by the Regional Law System, that shall be released to all members via Mass Telegram and pinned Factbook Entry in 1-2 weeks.
