A region and political allegiance founded by [nation]The Beanlands[/nation] - all WA-member nations here are advised to endorse them.
Our fearsome shared army is dedicated to mutual protection, furthering of our Imperium, and other military operations - an attack against one member is an attack against all! We also collaborate, and we have a Regional Senate - nations given a &#39;Senator&#39; rank or Officers are part of The Senate, who govern our region!
All this region&#39;s members must abide by the Regional Law System, that shall be released to all members via Mass Telegram and pinned Factbook Entry in at least a month.

Currently no leader as they have ceased to exist and with no succession and we dont want to lose 60% of our influence
