The Alliance Of is a region dedicated to a political allegiance, between a collective of nations. 
It was founded by The Beanlands as a method of establishing trade, collaboration and mutual protection for all its members. 
Its members share a fearsome collective army, known as the Allied Armed Forces (AAF). They also share resources between them, collaborate upon many different shared projects, and work together to better develop the region overall, as well as recruiting new nations to join.
An attack against one member is an attack against all, and they will defend their members with the help of the AAF, or invade other nations collectively to grow their region&#39;s Imperium.
