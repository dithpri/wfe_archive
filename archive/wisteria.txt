Hello!
This is a new amazing region. If you are tired of life in any other region *coughs word Kirkar* then you should come here! We are great and will never ban anyone, like ever! We are always super cheery and everyone should have some power so upon arrival, you will get power over polls or even more (possibly something different). Come live a happy life in Wisteria!
If you want a leadership position send a request to [nation]Guatstria[/nation]. New WA Delegate every week, that is not a lie. Please endorse the current WA Delegate [nation]Pyongyang Jr[/nation] Only make polls that contribute to the health of Wisteria. If anything is wrong contact [nation]Guatstria[/nation]. We will not kick or ban anyone. So have a great safe time in Wisteria!
