The International Treaty Organization, or ITO, is a freedom-type region. While the IDP is not as active now, with plans to restabilize or at least continue her legacy within, the ITO stands strong against any threats to the realm. Stability has been reached. Peace is restored after multiple attempts to thwart it. Telegram any of the Regional Officers for either more information or for an application to join. 

Undying Freedom and Justice Until The End.
