International Treaty Organization (ITO) is a democratic alliance hoping to take down Dictatorship and bring Freedom to Great Lengths. We are on a recruiting drive for WA Nations to endorse [nation]Laketovia[/nation] and be ready to mobilize in case of invasion or us or allies. We plan to improve ties with others and hopefully make embassies and alliances to unite with a common goal: To Spread Freedom. Ever since the 12th of September, 20XX, The Soviets united factions under the original name ITO.

As of Feb 23, 20XX, we are officially a signatory member of the TZC and Interrecional Defense Pact and are at a Cold War with Garmintia.
