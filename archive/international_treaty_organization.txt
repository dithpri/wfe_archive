International Treaty Organization (ITO) (Note: ITO is now a subsection of the Freedom Crusaders) is a democratic alliance hoping to take down Dictatorship and bring Freedom to Great Lengths. When you join, you are welcomed with open arms and are free to change your mind at any time. We plan to improve ties with others and hopefully make embassies and alliances to unite with a common goal: To Spread the true meaning of Freedom. Ever since the 12th of September, 20XX, we have decided to settle differences with the Soviets, uniting factions under a new name, the Freedom Crusaders, though the old name of the International Treaty Organization can still be used.

As of September 18, 20XX, we are officially a signatory member of the TZC
