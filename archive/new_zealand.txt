New Zealand is a peaceful and idyllic group of islands in the South Pacific.  Everyone welcome.

Thanks to [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] of [region]The New Inquisition[/region], [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region] and [region]Albion[/region], for having the decency and sense of fair play to return this region to its native members.
