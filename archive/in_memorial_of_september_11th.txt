This region was created as a memorial for those who lost their lives as well as their families due the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. We must never forget this tragic day of United States history, and we must continue to remember those whose lives were effected by these attacks.

Stop in and pay your dues, or stay for a while... it&amp;#39;s up to you.
