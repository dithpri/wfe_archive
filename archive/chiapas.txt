The Free and Sovereign State of Chiapas is the southernmost State of Mexico. It is divided into 118 municipalities and its capital city is Tuxtla Guti&eacute;rrez. Other important population centers in Chiapas include San Crist&oacute;bal de las Casas, Comit&aacute;n, and Tapachula.

Chiapas is home to the ancient Mayan ruins of Palenque, Yaxchil&aacute;n, Bonampak, and Chinkultic. It is also home to one of the largest indigenous populations in the country with twelve federally recognized ethnicities. Much of the state&#146;s history is centered on the subjugation of these peoples with occasional rebellions. The last of these rebellions was the 1994 Zapatista uprising, which succeeded in obtaining new rights for indigenous people.
