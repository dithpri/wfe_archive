Trying individuals for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and aggression
The Court is participating in a global fight to end impunity, and through international criminal justice, the Court aims to hold those responsible accountable for their crimes and to help prevent these crimes from happening again.

&amp;#8203;&amp;#8203;The Court cannot reach these goals alone. As a court of last resort, it seeks to complement, not replace, national Courts. Governed by an international treaty called the Rome Statute, the ICC is the world&#146;s first permanent international criminal court.
Towards stability and lasting peace.
