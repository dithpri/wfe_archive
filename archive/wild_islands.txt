This region is basically a bunch of islands. Each region has at least one island. The different nations here are supposed to work together. For some reason, there are a lot of cats in this region. And rain. And trees. And eagles. Yay!
The only rule of this region is try to protect the environment. And the people. Yeah.
Raining Cats is the only nation in this region so far. It is the founder. So, if you have a nation here you must like cats and have a currency that works easily with the Raining Cats currency of keys.
Welcome to Wild Islands!
