This region represents the Heptarchy and its sphere of influence. 

Any nations who join renounce all other allegiances and agree to operate under the Heptarchy as a satellite state. They must pay yearly tribute (10% of GDP) and must also send resources to New Terrisia to be distributed across the Heptarchy.

Nations who wish to become an official colony may also join.
