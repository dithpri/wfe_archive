    The region of Communia is a place for those that believe that with strict rules come a valued freedom.

    The Earth shall be protected at all costs, for it is our only home, and from this bond we shall all thrive. 

     No mans belief or personal freedom should be hindered, and neither should it hinder another. 

     The needs of the many, over the needs of the one.
