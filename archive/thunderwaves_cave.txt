Personal abode of [nation]Improper Classifications[/nation]/Thunderwave Cave/Classified Property/other alt names. You may have seen me lurking around Gameplay and the Security Council, and occasionally on Got Issues, General, or F7. Won&#39;t see me on RP forums though :p
Embassy requests might be accepted. Contact me first, and I&#39;ll do you the courtesy of flipping a coin. Heads, sure. Tails, nah.
I&#39;m up for merc raiding work almost never. If it&#39;s really that important, my discord is thunderwave89.
