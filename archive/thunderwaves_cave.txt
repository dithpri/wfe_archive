[i]In the dark cave known as Thunderwaves Cave, your paws barely make any sound as they touch the stone. You do not see a thing. You pad forward and then, you are blinded by a dazzling light. In front of you stands a huge, bright, blue stone. You walk forward and touch your nose to the stone and close your eyes. You find yourself in a peaceful forest, where cats just like you, with stars in their fur, work peacefully. A bright, white cat turns from making soup and introduces themself as Hopkins. He looks down on you with pride, and gives you a life.[/i]
