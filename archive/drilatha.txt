LORE
This region takes place in a mid 2020&#39;s world where through history fantastic magics have existed they have slipped further into myth. Drilatha is a dimension lost to many. Throughout time those who had closed their eyes to the abnormal have passed over this realm, a world of wondrous magics and magnificent sciences, a true utopia. But like all good things the world grew divided. Those who once worked together now realized there own potential as a nation of their own.
