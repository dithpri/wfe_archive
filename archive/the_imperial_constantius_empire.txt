Welcome to The Imperial Constantius Empire!

United we stand, together we stay.

The empire&#39;s landscape is impressive; green forests, red leaved trees and steep, magnificent mountains are just a sliver of the elegance Constantius has to offer, which is why the empire is beloved among foreigners.
The people of Constantius are warm towards foreigners and tend to welcome them with open hands. Although they feel foreigners could suppress the country&#39;s well being.

Amadeus has rough laws and law enforcement, which is fairly normal. The people are distressed due to ferocious wildlife, caused by angered spirits.
