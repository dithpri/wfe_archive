[i]Ideobinary is a term from the alibinary system used to categorize the experiences of some non-binary individuals. It refers to people with identities that rely on masculinity and/or femininity or other &#147;projections&#148; of binary ideas, without being necessarily close to binary genders. Their experience relies on binary-related concepts, but they do not have an experience that is similar of that of a binary gender.[/i]
