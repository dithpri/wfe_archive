Just a thought...

I thought it would be cool to be the founder and bouncer of a nightclub-themed region.
The &amp;quot;NSFW&amp;quot; is just to indicate that kids under 18 aren&amp;#39;t allowed in.
(For those of you unfamiliar with this thing called &amp;quot;the Internet,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;NSFW&amp;quot; stands for &amp;quot;Not Safe For Work.&amp;quot;)

Maybe I&amp;#39;ll do something with this region, maybe I won&amp;#39;t.
But even if I don&amp;#39;t, having your own region is better than hanging out in a sinker or feeder.

If you want to join or if you have any questions, contact the founder,
