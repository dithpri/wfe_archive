&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; RULES &amp; REMINDERS:
 No being overpowered. (also, be realistic)
Do not be rude to or harass anyone.
Advertisements unrelated to the RP are not allowed and will be deleted.
 Don&#39;t get mad at me if I don&#39;t update the RP. I am constantly busy.
If you declare war on a nation, you must give a proper reason (or a casus belli) for doing so.) You are allowed to block the war declaration of someone who does not have a casus belli.
Occupying all of a country will stiffen resistance against you.
The longer a war you started goes on, the more stability you will lose.
 You are allowed to override the decisions of your puppet states to a certain extent.
