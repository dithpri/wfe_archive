&#147;The Empire in this story is based on a what-if scenario where the German empire unified under the Gro&szlig;deutsche L&ouml;sung (&quot;Greater German solution&quot;), so that all German-speaking peoples came together under one state. If peace had managed to continue throughout the 1910s and war broke out later, during the years between World War I and World War II, how would things be different? In that scenario, there wouldn&#39;t be any room for a demagogue like Hitler to come into power.&#148;
