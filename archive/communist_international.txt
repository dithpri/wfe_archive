The Communist International is back in our hands and is in the process of being returned to it&amp;#39;s former state. An election has been held to determine the new official WA delegate; the winner of which is [nation]Misha22[/nation]. All WA members are advised to endorse the rightfully elected delegate and [I]if necessary[/I] unendorse me. Thank you for all of your cooperation during this time. Additionally, thanks to all the regions that have contacted us with offers of support, embassies, and alliance. We will properly respond to these offers in due time but are currently working to reestablish our government. Know that a lack of response on our part during this time is NOT indicative of a lack of interest. Thank you.
