Welcome to The Council of Islamic States

Over concerns of Islamaphobic fascists occupying our region this region has been secured. We acknowledge some in our community were not good people but those of us that are still active and were part of that community do not hold those views and those people have been since disgraced. We are here to show Islam is a peaceful religion and we will accept people regardless of sexuality or race, simply on merit.

&#147;When an honorable person obtains knowledge it humbles him and when a legislator obtains knowledge he becomes proud.&#148; Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (RA)
