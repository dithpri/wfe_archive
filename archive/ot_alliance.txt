Seriously, bring some sunscreen. The Almighty goH will burn the flesh from the unbelievers and infidels. It rained last year once I think. Missiles on our enemies that is!!!!!!

The Family: Look, you don&amp;#39;t like your family, and we don&amp;#39;t like ours. We do however, relish the chance to fire our AK47s into the air at any family gathering. Oh one more important thing. Women are to be cherished, like the expensive piece of personal property that they are! We just passed a law that a woman should be traded for no less than two goats! Tell me that isn&amp;#39;t progress!


Accept our embassy and prosper.
