In the Summer of 2013, when [b]the [region]Femdom Empire[/region][/b] and her allies were busy liberating [b][region]the Feminist Region[/region][/b], some foolish misogynists from a tiny backwater region called &amp;quot;OT Alliance&amp;quot; attacked us there.

They utterly failed, of course, not only to take [region]the Feminist Region[/region] from us, but to keep their own home region from the spiked heel of FemDom rule.

(And I want to make clear, this was not naked aggression on [b]the [region]Femdom Empire[/region]&amp;#39;s[/b] part. The original inhabitants of this region drew first blood, not us. No nation, region or organization that is not misogynistic has anything to fear from [b]the [region]Femdom Empire[/region][/b].)
