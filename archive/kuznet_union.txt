The greatest union of communist and authoritarian nations to have ever existed.

The Kuznet Union believes in the &quot;IDEAS&quot; principles for governing our mighty nations
I- Ideological Radicality
D- Dictatorship
E- Enforcement

We do not tolerate nor accept capitalistic pig nations who believe in the wrong ideology called &quot;Democracy&quot;. The union will always be there to support our glorious communist comrades.

The Kuznet Union boasts some of the highest world rankings in our founding principles, with our independent nations of the union alone performing much better than the average of the Kuznet Union.
