Come one, Come all
(and by &amp;quot;all&amp;quot; I mean Dictators)

Come and relish in the glory of power and leadership.
Prance in the industrial parks that boom the ever growing economy,
take a stroll on the slightly glowing beaches and breath in the smoky air that erupts from our ever billowing smokestacks.

Come and let us join hands and form the largest military that our foes have ever seen.
Come and let us rule our people to work in our factories and reward the people that help make this land the marvelous iron fisted land it always is and always will.
