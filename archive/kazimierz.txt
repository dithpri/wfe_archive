Kazimierz lies in a rugged and boreal region defined by its vast coniferous forests, sprawling tundras, and glacial highlands. The land is marked by cold, harsh winters, short but bountiful summers, and a network of icy rivers that feed into deep, glacial lakes. Kazimierz is a land steeped in history, with ancient trade routes cutting through its dense woods, connecting northern iron deposits to southern markets. The terrain fosters tight-knit communities, where survival depends on mutual support and shared traditions rooted in knightly codes and a reverence for the land.
