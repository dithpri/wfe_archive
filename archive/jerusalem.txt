Jerusalem enjoys a unique position. It has played a crucial role in religious history as a holy city for the three monotheistic religions, Judaism being the first.

For thousands of years Jerusalem has been the temporal and spiritual center of The Land of Israel, the Holy Land, for which more tears and blood have been shed and more prayers offered than for any other place on Earth.

Jerusalem is the eternal undivided capital of the State of Israel.[hr][color=navy]Anti-Zionist nations will not be tolerated here!!![/color][/b]
