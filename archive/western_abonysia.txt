Greetings, Western Abonysians. Today I wish to present to all a new home for us! Let us now cast away revolution, and welcome Freedom, Liberty, and Democracy to our storied and free land. Let us also never forget where we came from, a land of deceit, war, poverty, and secularism.

Deo Vindice!

Stephanus, Councilman of Teradonos.
