A group of crazy nations.

[nation]Atheists[/nation] - A nation born of tragedy and war. This nation will try to help however it can. If, that is, the help you require includes; cannibalism, murder, insanity, or murder. Did I mention cannibalism?

[nation]Atheists 2[/nation] - A nation that bore a child to another nation that was born of tragedy and war. This nation will not help you, but instead, it will try to control your people, convert you, and kill anybody who doesn&#39;t convert. 7/10 bad Uber driver. Gave me free gum though.

[nation]Glaarkian Advisor[/nation] - This nation is not a nation, but an embassy from another nation that doesn&#39;t have the power to create [i]actua[/i] embassies in his region. Also it makes them look more professional.
