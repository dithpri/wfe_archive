Welcoming members of [region]The Global Roleplay Region[/region].

In this prototype RP, your largest city is under quarantine full of zombies and surviving factions. Make sure that the outside world of your quarantine is chaotic because of a low economy. Have fun as the trial period goes. The official Roleplay will open once the trial period is successful.
