The Shiniest place to ever exist, where the walls, ceilings, floors, plates, cups, cutlery, tables, chairs, and even the food is made out of gold. King Midas&#39; nightmare, or perhaps a literal goldmine? We&#39;ve yet to find out.

Come along, hang out, drink hot chocolate from a golden cup, we don&#39;t care! We&#39;re just happy to have you with us in The Shiny Place.
