Edhelgaer is the place where Tangaliro and several nations are located in.As the nations were still quite weak,they decided to form a long-term alliance to ensure safety and future development, and at this point TESU is being founded on the Day of Unity under the lead and arrangement of Tangaliro. Nowadays, a few foreign nations also joined in the organization for protection and cooperation.

TESU is neither a socialist coalition nor a capitalist or democratic union,it&#39;s not a united kingdom either.Instead,it&#39;s a regional defense and economic pact that tolerates different ideologies,combining the advantages of each other to raise the total power of the whole continent.
