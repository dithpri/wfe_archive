Hyrule, a wreck of a town that is under a red sky thick with smoke, patrolled by ReDeads, and ruled by Ganondorf. Around the castle is a bleak wasteland known as [color=gold][b]&amp;quot;Hyrule Field&amp;quot;[/b][/color]. There  is a village at the base of [color=red][b]&amp;quot;Death Mountain&amp;quot;[/b][/color] volcano known as [color=indigo][b]&amp;quot;Kakariko Village&amp;quot;[/b][/color]. The rock-like Gorons live in [color=red][b]&amp;quot;Death Mountain&amp;quot;[/b][/color], but are about to be eaten by the dragon Volvagia. Near there is a waterfall, and behind that waterfall is a cave covered in ice known as [color=blue][b]&amp;quot;Zora&amp;#39;s Domain&amp;quot;[/b][/color], where the Zora live. The Zora are a human-fish hybrid. There is also the [color=green][b]&amp;quot;Kokiri Forest&amp;quot;[/b][/color], a forest that the Kokiri call home, and is now overrun by monsters. The Kokiri are a race of humans that stay children forever. Past the forest is [color=orange][b]&amp;quot;Gerudo Desert&amp;quot;[/color][/b], Ganondorf&amp;#39;s ancestral home.
