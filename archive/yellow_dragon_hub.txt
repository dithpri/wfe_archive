The eastern seaboard of China is not entirely under one nation and they are not alone. Finally, after a short-lived, yet brutal conflict with the Chinese government, we now regained control of the Shanghai Metropolitan Area, and are beginning repairs on our original hub along with 10 years of repayment towards China. Not only that, we have access to Taiwan, Hainan, and the surrounding southern lands, co-existing with the Chinese as part of a compromise.

We can&#39;t hide or escape during Z-Day, so we must stay awake with every bit of energy we have and take up arms against the zombie hordes. This will be our ONLY chance to tear Asia apart.
