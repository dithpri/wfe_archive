The Armed Federation of Sovereign States, also known as AFSS, is a fiercely independent federation of states with a common goal of freedom, seriousness and peace. Created on the 5th of Febuary 2014 it is planning on rapidly expanding and has since issued a socialist market economy. We plan on becoming a small yet powerful organisation that is headstrong in what it does and strives for democracy and sovereignty. We abide by ourselves and ourselves only, we know no rules apart form our own and we live by our motto to every word: &amp;quot;All the forces in the world are not so powerful as an idea whose time has come.&amp;quot;
