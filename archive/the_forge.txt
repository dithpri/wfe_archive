The Forge is a warm temperate region where the Wilk river flows from the near inland Attensam mountains to the ocean. The land in-between is marked by rolling medium-large hills to the south and smoother agricultural plains to the north. Past the Attensam mountains lie the Egonne flatlands, in which the Weit Gorge stands out as an idyllic visitor oasis along the wide but shallow Oska river. Raft rides down this river, which shares an origin point with the Wilk, are common activities.
