Welcome Compromising fellows! This region is here for those who like peaceful solutions to conflicts and true diplomacy not uncompromising slander. This region was founded in the event of the Vortukia-Strategos conflict in protest of the lack of compromise and correct diplomatic talks on both sides. All who are peaceful negotiators are welcome here and for further information see the Constitution (in progress).
