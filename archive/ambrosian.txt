The state of Ambrosian. Built upon the war, endurance and sacrifices of its past, this state is now among the most self-reliant countries in its corner of the world.
Their infrastructure, science and public health are among its current greatest strengths. Unfortunately, they lack a little in sustainability and food production.

The people of Ambrosian are pleased. They live brilliant lives and while sustainability might be lacking, their infrastructure helps relief most of their issues.
Religion holds barely any importance in their lives and, if anything, has made them more dedicated. The people of Ambrosian are very spiritual however and they have beautiful customs and an abundance of celebrations.
