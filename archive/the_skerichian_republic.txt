Welcome to Skerichia, the people&#39;s place. Even though this legendary nation is home to ~1 billion people, Skerichia is still pretty small compared to other larger, different nations.

Skerichia is consisted of 5 Regions: Corba, Kui, Terro, Dorna, and Fuo. All consist of the same laws as it&#39;s home founder as well as its own laws. Skerichia is open for more states to join, and everyone&#39;s invited! Join now!
