Welcome, [color=red]Comrades[/color]!

The region to Chen Taou is located in Southeast Asia, mainly China.

This region was formed upon the ideas of [color=red]Communism[/color] and [color=yellow]Socialism[/color].

In our alternate-history timeline, China has fallen due to political instability and many city-states have taken control of old China, the most prominent of them being [nation]Zyong Hi[/nation] and [nation]Shan Xi[/nation], which have taken control and puppeted many surrounding states.

Upon entrance, send a telegram to [nation=short]Shan Xi[/nation] or [nation=short]Zyong Hi[/nation] to state you are not a threat, otherwise, you will be ejected.
