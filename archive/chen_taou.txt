This new region just located 500 kilometers south of the old Zyong Hi is just being discovered, all animals found seem friendly and food is very plentiful, the climate is fairly warm, but who knows when it will become warmer due to pollution of the city.  It seems as if many people have been working here for YEARS without letting the Zyong Hi government know.  All i can say is we will leave the government of the old Zyong Hi and start in our new region found with a city the size of Manhattan already built by fellow Zyong Hians!
