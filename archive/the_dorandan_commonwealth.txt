Established by the fledgling Republic of Doranda, the Commonwealth is a collection of nations that share a similar ideology as the founding nation. As of now it consists of only the founding nation and so the Dorandan Council is its governing body but when more nations begin to join, the Council will then pass power over to a regional government with representatives from those countries.
