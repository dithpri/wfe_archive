Islas Camaalot is a strip of large islands within the Pacific home to many great nations varying from psychotic dictatorships to Right-wing Utopias. Islas Camaalot was founded by the nation of Rubilac Ex whose great leader, King Arthur II, is proud that the people stayed to their roots when naming both the Nation and the Region.
