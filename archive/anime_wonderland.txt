Anime is everything
Looking to start a new region with casual players who also love to watch/read anime!

Not going to bore you with ton of rules but I am considering a few initially:

Must act with respect towards all players in region
No harassment of any kind!
Must have knowledge of the basic mechanics of  Nationstates game play
All players welcome, new or old
Must participate in at least 1 login per week
And last but not least, LOVE anime of all types

Since this is in it&#39;s early stages (region) I am definitely also looking for anyone who wishes to help me recruit and build this region.
