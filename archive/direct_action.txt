[b]Direct Action[/b]

[u]Mission Statement:[/u] 
[i]&amp;quot;To topple any authoritarian regional government and spread anarchism through insurrectionary means.&amp;quot;[/i]

[u]Organization and Policy[/u]
[i]DA is organized on the principle of &amp;quot;leaderless resistance&amp;quot;, thus, anyone may use the label in their raid, so long as they abide by the core tenets. Any region that is successfully captured by a group using the DA banner needs to open an embassy with this region, to keep tabs on our the war effort. This region, being absolutely decentralized and independent, will not enter alliances with any other region.[/i]

[u]Three Core Tenets[/u]
[i]DA cannot be used as a justification for imperialism. DA cannot support or collaborate with authoritarians. DA will never reveal the identity of its supporters.[/i]
