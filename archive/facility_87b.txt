[hr]FACILITY #87-B FACTBOOK PARAGRAPH #1[hr]
Facility #87-B is a test facility that people thought was closed down, but turned out had people living there, so it was colonized. The natives angrily revolted and were squashed like grapes for wine, and they vanished mysteriously. Probably cursed, and doomed to collapsed any day now, Facility #87-B is best to be left to the professionals. Professionals of what? You be the judge.
