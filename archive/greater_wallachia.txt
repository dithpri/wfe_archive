[b]Greater Wallachia[/b] - [i]The greatest unrecognized one-party regional polity in South-Central Europe![/i]
We have a proud and storied history, with roots reaching to distant times in the past, some even before glorious Soviet occupation.
With these proud peoples, Greater Wallachia is objectively the best Wallachia to ever grace the Balkans, except for perhaps Grand Wallachia or the Vlacho-Wallachian Empire.
It is certainly better than other competitors, such as Best Wallachia, Wallachia Prime, Lesser Wallachia, and Poland.
