This Underground City was created to be able to have a safe haven from the worries of the surface. Its a place meant for merchants to gather and sell whatever they may please and for those obsessed with the arts to indulge in their craft. We also welcome those who want to study sciences and magics both generally accepted and taboo (just keep it contained to one room). It&#39;s also a safe haven and has vast halls for debate, which Fliffleville is known to enjoy a good debate so these halls are ornate with tables always stocked with food.
