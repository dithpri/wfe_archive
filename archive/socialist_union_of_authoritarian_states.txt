The smooth flow of [region]Lone Wolves United[/region] has entered your cozy little region and we&#39;ve decided to bring the [i]heat[/i]. To set the mood, we&#39;ve decided to put on a record and keep it nice and low.

If you want to take it back to our place, you know you&#39;re invited. Hop on over [url=s1.zetaboards.com/Invader_Haven/index/]to our forum[/url] to join us in celebrating.
