The Warmed Earth is a fledgling hypothetical region that takes place after climate change drastically changed our world. From habitable regions becoming uninhabitable and vice versa, the livable area of Earth moved from where it is now closer to the poles. This has had a drastic effect on how humankind lives in this world, from the Equatorial regions becoming sparsely populated which encourages heavy survivalism, to areas of permafrost becoming thawed, beckoning a new age of agriculture. Some areas have benefited greatly from an influx of people into new lands while others have seen entire nations go up in flames. Will you be able to survive in this brave new world?
