An alliance formed by countries that contribute to the cause of the Starshot Mercenaries. This alliance of nations is called the Honorary Sanctuary Legion. Intergalactic mercenaries are quickly becoming a critically endangered race, but with your support they can thrive again. The terrorist organisation of Chromobius has almost ensured the destruction of the Starshot Mercenaries, and here we harbor the remaining few from the long reach of Derek Mobius. We ask that new nations create factbooks about themselves to give substance to their culture, history, religion, etc. We also request that nations join the World Assembly.
