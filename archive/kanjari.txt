This region has now been taken over twice by [region=The Black Riders] I really don&amp;#39;t understand the interest in Kanjari. But whatever it is it doesn&amp;#39;t matter in fact it gives me a sense of purpose when they raid because I actually get to spend a couple minutes working on my region. I&amp;#39;ve taken care of everything besides the flag because I&amp;#39;m on my phone right now and can&amp;#39;t fix that but honestly i can appreciate the flag so it will stay up for a while. Oh yeah so the nations responsible are as follows:
[nation=short]Great Kleonentia[/nation]
[nation=short]Vandoosa[/nation]
