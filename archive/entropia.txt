[b]THE GREAT RECKONING SHALL COME![/b]

Those are our words, mongrels. Learn them well while you still draw breath. This is home to the immortal [nation]Makluan[/nation] dynasty which once ruled the Forgotten Isles! To all those who have been wronged by the despicable World Assembly and self righteous so-called nations, or refuse to live in [region]the Rejected Realms[/region] in shame, join our ranks! We promise, you will have your just retribution!

And to those who dare call themselves our enemies, we can only promise you a slow and agonizing demise. This world belongs to Makluan, vermin. Submit while you can!
