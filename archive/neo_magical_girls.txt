[i]When Freedom&#39;s wings unfurl and soar,
Our thoughts take flight, forever more,
No bounds or chains can hold us down,
As we explore, our minds astound.

With literature as our guide,
And imagination at our side,
We wander worlds both old and new,
And shape them with a word or two.

The power of thought is our great gift,
A priceless treasure, one which uplifts,
For in the realms of mind and soul,
Freedom reigns, and we&#39;re made whole.

So let us cherish this sacred right,
To think and speak without fright,
And honor all who fought and bled,
To keep these freedoms ever-fed.

For in our thoughts we find our soul,
And in freedom, we find our goal,
To live and love and create anew,
And make our dreams a living hue.[/i]
