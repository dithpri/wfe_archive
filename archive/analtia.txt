Analtia is an extremely small region located in what is perhaps the oldest part of the world. It has been controlled by the Arokhians for over 10,000 years. Little is know about Analtia as the people in this region mainly keep to themselves and rarely involve themselves in outside affairs. However, Arokh is fiercely protective of Analtia and will not hesitate to destroy any and all potential threats that come too near the borders of the region. 
Analtia is the only known region to hold species of Fae Dragon.
