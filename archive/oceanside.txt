[b][color=blue]Our numbers aren&amp;#39;t many. [u]We know that.[/u][/color]

[color=orange]But we have what many regions lack... a close and active community. Our region gives you freedom to [/color]vote for a delegate,[color=orange] or to [/color][color=orange]contribute to further changes.[/color]

Oh, and we&amp;#39;ve also been here for [b][u]over a year.[/b][/u] [/color]
