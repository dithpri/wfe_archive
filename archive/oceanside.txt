[b]Our numbers aren&amp;#39;t many. [u]We know that.[/u] But we have what many regions lack... a close and active community. Our region gives you freedom to vote for a delegate, or to contribute to further changes. And it is because of our small numbers that we are able to do all these things, an opportunity most regions will never receive. [/b]


[color=green][u]Please take some time to recruit. RMB Recruiting is fine [i][b]if the region allows[/i][/b]. Telegrams are fine too (don&amp;#39;t make them stupid). Thank you![/u][/color]
