[b]Our numbers aren&amp;#39;t many. [u]We know that.[/u] But we have what many regions lack... a close and active community. Our region gives you freedom to vote for a delegate, or to contribute to further changes. And it is because of our small numbers that we are able to do all these things, an opportunity most regions will never receive. [/b]


The new [nation=Super-Llamaland] administration would like to thank the active members of [region=oceanside]. Thanks!
