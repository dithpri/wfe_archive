[b][color=blue]Our numbers aren&amp;#39;t many. [u]We know that.[/u][/color]

[color=orange]But we have what many regions lack... a close and active community. Our region gives you freedom to [/color]vote for a delegate,[color=orange] or to [/color][color=orange]contribute to further changes.[/color]

[color=purple]And it is because of our small numbers that we are able to do all these things, an opportunity most regions will never receive. [/color][/b] [color=red]

Oh, and we&amp;#39;ve also been here for [b][u]over a year.[/b][/u] [/color]


[color=green][u]Please take some time to recruit some active members if you can. RMB Recruiting is fine [i][b]if the region allows[/i][/b]. Telegrams are fine too (don&amp;#39;t make them stupid). Thank you![/u][/color]

[b][color=blue]WE NEED A NEW MOTTO!!! CREATE YOUR MOTTO AND TG IT TO SUPER-LLAMALAND! THE WINNING MOTTO WILL BECOME OUR REGIONAL MOTTO, SO TURN IN THOSE MOTTOS NOW![/b][/color]
