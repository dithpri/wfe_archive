[b][u]We&amp;#39;re now temporarily living in [region]Lakeshore[/region]! Please come if you are wondering where we are![/b][/u]
Also, if you&amp;#39;re thinking, &amp;quot;LET&amp;#39;S RAID THIS AREA!!!&amp;quot; don&amp;#39;t. I monitor this every few hours so I can prevent you from bringing your government into this area.
Also, for an act of security, the delegate has no powers for the moment. Sorry :(
