We are currently a vassal state for [region]The Havenite Commonwealth[/region] and a placeholder region for dependents on said region.

Some would even call us a &quot;puppet region&quot;, but rest assured this rumor is far from true.  We merely enjoy a prosperous alliance and have a proper military force.  

We advise [b]all[/b] member-states to join the [url=www.nationstates.net/page=un]World Assembly[/url] as we will be able to provide proper internal security and prosperity for one another in this way.
