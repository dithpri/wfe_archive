The Holy Empire of the Os Tides was founded by Praey Thyae, a republic located off the coast of the Osnanic Ocean, in the early fifth century. Despite it&#39;s sheer size, it dares not venture over the waters to conquer Osnan as the Osnanic Ocean is treacherous and the Osnanic peoples more so, especially with their military growing faster than their alliances with other nearby nations. The purpose of the Holy Empire is to spread their influence across their continent and no further than the shores of their Holy land as their Gods forbid it. Why else would they put the ocean there?
