This is a region for nations that openly question international norms about democracy, rights (both political and civil), and war. Our founding principle is that Dictatorship is the most efficient form of government. Democracy is an opiate for the masses that in reality only benefits corrupt and wealthy politicians. Nations that are not one party states, have more than one  ruler, hold elections, or engage in any kind of Democratic practice are not welcome, and will be ejected immediately.
