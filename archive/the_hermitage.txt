Welcome to the Hermitage! If you&#39;re looking for NS&#39;s library environment, you found it. The only posts allowed on the RMB are a matter of record-keeping (welcome messages to new nations and farewells to departing nations), you&#39;ll never get official regional spam in your TGs, and endorsements are neither requisite nor regulated. You&#39;ll also find that we&#39;re raid-proof as we&#39;ve quite reasonably password protected the region. It&#39;s the perfect place to quietly stash alts or establish a nation before taking it to another region for raiding or RP.

All of that said, welcome and sssshhhhh... ;)
