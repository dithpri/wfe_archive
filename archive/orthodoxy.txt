It is idle to talk always of the alternative of reason and faith. Reason is itself a matter of faith. It is an act of faith to assert that our thoughts have any relation to reality at all. If you are merely a sceptic, you must sooner or later ask yourself the question, &amp;quot;Why should ANYTHING go right; even observation and deduction? Why should not good logic be as misleading as bad logic? They are both movements in the brain of a bewildered ape?&amp;quot; The young sceptic says, &amp;quot;I have a right to think for myself.&amp;quot; But the old sceptic, the complete sceptic, says, &amp;quot;I have no right to think for myself. I have no right to think at all.&amp;quot;
