Vexillology is the study of the history, symbolism and usage of flags or, by extension, any interest in flags in general. The word is a synthesis of the Latin word vexillum (which refers to a kind of square flag which was carried by Roman cavalry) and the Greek suffix -logia (&quot;study&quot;). 

A person who studies flags is a vexillologist, one who designs flags is a vexillographer, and the art of flag-designing is called vexillography. One who is a hobbyist or general admirer of flags is a vexillophile. 

The study of flags, or vexillology, was formalized by the U.S. scholar and student of flags [nation]Whitney Smith[/nation] in 1961 with the publication of The Flag Bulletin. He was also one of the founders of the [nation]FIAV[/nation].
