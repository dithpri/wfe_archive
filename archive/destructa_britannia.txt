~*~Welcome to Destructa Britannia!~*~

Hundreds of Years ago, the galaxy was a paradise. The Empires of old lead their populations into never ending golden ages, secure in their dominance of the stars. Now though, that is all over. It isnt known for sure by anyone what happened to cause this great collapse, or if the world has ever been anything other than the blasted hellhole it is now. All that can be said with certainty is that Terra, while irradiated and scarred beyond recognition, lives on. Its people struggle every day for their very survival among the ruins of what used to be. Can there be hope in this bleak and devestaed world? Only you can decide.
