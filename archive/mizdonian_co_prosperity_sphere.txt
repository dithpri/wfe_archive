The Mizdonian Co-Prosperity Sphere (abbreviated as  MCPS), also called the Ballstopian Coalition, is an intergovernmental military alliance of Ballstopian member states. Established in the aftermath of the 2nd fall of Ballstopia, the organization implements the Maroon-Turquoise Concordat, signed by Tsar Ivan Yakinov of Denouttaden and King Adrien Mauvais of Mizdonia, on the 23rd August 2024 in the city of New Deez. MCPS is a collective security system: its independent member states agree to defend each other against attacks by third parties. The organization&#39;s motto is Potestas Unitum Voluntatem. The organization&#39;s strategic concepts include those frowned upon by the World Assembly.
