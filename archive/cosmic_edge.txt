A somber, vast, and dimly lit region of space, the Cosmic Edge is the furthest inhabitable point in interstellar space away from the center of the universe. In the cluster of dwarf galaxies that clutch onto the walls of reality, exist many fledgling civilizations, and peculiarly enough, several cosmic anomalies that have entered the universe from the &quot;outside&quot;, or perhaps from places even beyond that. With the incredible isolation of those who reside here, contact with the outside universe may have drastic consequences for both the inhabitants of the Cosmic Edge, outsiders, and most importantly, those from beyond.
