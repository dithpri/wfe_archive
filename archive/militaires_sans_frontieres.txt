Militaires Sans Frontieres is a small mercenary entity. We have no nation, no philosophy, no ideology. We go where we have to, where money is. We don&#39;t need reasons to fight. We fight because we must. We will be the deterrent force of those who need it. We are soldiers without borders, our goals are defined by the times we live in. If these times require it, we will be revolutionaries, criminals or terrorists. This could lead us to Hell but is there any better place for us than this one?
