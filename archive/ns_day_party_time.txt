[Hr]&quot;What is this?&quot;

I&#39;m glad you asked! Starting on November 13th, there will be a theme. You will be encouraged to change your flag, motto, currency, and so forth to fit the theme of the day into your nation. There will also be daily questions on the theme on the RMB that may or may not sway the judges voting!
