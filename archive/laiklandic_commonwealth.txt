The Commonwealth is a region open to all those who have the same values. We are Third Positionists. We will not allow our culture, our people or our names be forgotten. We believe that the leftist and Nazi ideologies are a stain on humanity, and we will resist their advances at all costs, until the last man enters the great halls. We must make our moves with intelligence, and not be reckless. War is unfair, therefore anything in war works. We are not bound by treaties or agreements to limit our capabilities, but we are limited by common sense. Til Valhall! [/b]
