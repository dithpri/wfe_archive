This is the Andoran Empire. 

Every free nation that joins us receives the status of an Autonomous Republic and is henceforth under our protection. Each of these autonomous republics
is free in its decisions and developments. There is no compulsion to communicate or take any other action. There is only one duty: To recognize the Emperor
of the Andoran Empire and to endorse his Majesty. Together we are stronger!

Anselm Haut Rodric
Prime Minister of the Andoran Empire
