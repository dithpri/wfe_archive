[b]&quot;This is the Andoran Empire. We will defend our ideals by force of arms. 
We do not shrink an inch from our enemies and together withstand all
attacks from within and from without. Let the opponents of the Andoran
Empire know: All those who oppose our determination will be crushed by us.&quot;[/b]

From the speech manuscript of Emperor Valian IV. on the occasion of the
