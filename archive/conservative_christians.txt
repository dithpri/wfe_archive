We have an all new [url=http://conservativechristiansns.webstarts.com/]Website[/url]. 
We also prefer membership in the [region]World Assembly[/region], please join.

Everybody that is in the WA, endorse [nation]Ptura[/nation] at the moment, so that I&amp;#39;m not the Delegate. Until we have our formal election, Ptura is VP/WA Delegate since he is next in line according to our Constitution.

The voting that is on the Forums right now will not be correct. Don&amp;#39;t vote on them. We will post the official ballot on Friday night. Election sign-ups will end on Friday at noon.
