This is a group for all Conservative Christian nations in the world. My goal is to have at least 30-50 members by the end of the months. As soon as we have about 10-15 members, we will have elections for positions that I will decide at a later date. Tell all your friend nations about this region. All are welcome to join. We also encourage membership of the World Assembly (at the moment). Feel free to join. http://www.nationstates.net/page=un
