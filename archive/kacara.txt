[b][color=red]Welcome to Kacara![/color][/b]
We are a small region with a low self esteem.
[hr]

If you struggle with self confidence or have ever called yourself [b]trash[/b], feel free to join us in loathing. Our main goal is to not only promote loathing, but to also expand and create our incredibly complicated and oddly specific history. [i]Dispatches will be coming soon.[/i]
