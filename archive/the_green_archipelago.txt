The Green Archipelago is a chain of islands located in the Atlantic Ocean. The main island is &amp;quot;Pleasant Island&amp;quot;, Home of &amp;quot;The Republic of Pleasant Utopia&amp;quot;. The climate is very good and brings four well rounded seasons. Our conservative values rely on freedoms of speech, equality, religion (however, the society is founded on Christian beliefs.), and peoples choice in leaders. This Region is very abundant in fish, forests, and game. The Green Archipelago is rich in nature, good old family values, and of course nice, respectful citizens!
