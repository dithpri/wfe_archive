The Bad Lands is a region in the northern Great Plains with little to no land value. It actually extends to west central Pennsylvania. It is a sparsely populated region with roughly 30 people per square mile. Every Halloween, zombies arise out of the ground, and the Government declares a national state of emergency. If interested, we welcome you to the Bad Lands.
