The Land of the Bees is an island region off of the Southwest Coast of New Russia.

History:
Founded in February of 2066 after the near-execution of Old Russia&#39;s Republic, the survivors of the takeover fled to escape with their lives. They landed and set up their new home, and, noticing the large population of bees in the region, believed that the bees were the reason for their survival. Because of this, they named their new home &quot;The Land of the Bees.&quot; Even with New Russia actively seeking out and destroying any political opposition in the area, The Land of the Bees had somehow remained undiscovered by any nation.
