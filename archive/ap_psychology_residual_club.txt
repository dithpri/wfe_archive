Originating from a Connections Academy AP Psychology session, the AP PRC has been unknown and will not likely be popular or influential.
We are not affiliated with the People&amp;#39;s Republic of China.
We are called the AP Psychology Residual Club, because we are the last to leave during our class&amp;#39;s AP Psychology sessions. After the others leave, we remain.

Unofficial Regional Anthem:
When everyone else leaves, who remains? The grand AP PRC!
Who stays after the class session ends? The almighty AP PRC!
We stay! To converse! On important topics.
Even though they may not be important at all.

We aim to get to 10 nations!
We have plenty of unsettled land here. As long as you are not hostile, you can have a nation here!
