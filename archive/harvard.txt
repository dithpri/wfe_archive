I don&#39;t have much money but boy, if I did, I&#39;d buy a big house where we both could live.
So excuse me forgetting (but these things I do), see, I&#39;ve forgotten if they&#39;re green or they&#39;re blue.
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean... yours are the sweetest eyes I&#39;ve ever seen.
And you can tell everybody this is your song. It may be quite simple, but now that it&#39;s done -- I hope you don&#39;t mind (I hope you don&#39;t mind) that I put down in words how wonderful life is now that you&#39;re in the world.
