[b]This region has been taken by [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] with the combined might of [region]The New Inquisition[/region],  [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region] and [region]Albion[/region].

With speed and precision, no region is safe from the imperialist juggernaut.  All shall tremble in fear at the sight of wings and talons!

The Founderless Regions Alliance isn&amp;#39;t safe from the force of the UIAF!

Praise the Kaiserin! Long live the Emperor! Glory to the King! 

Thanks to our allies from [region]Europeia[/region] and [region]Kantrias[/region]. [/b]
