[b][color=Maroon]Hello,[/color][/b]

[b][color=Red] Welcome to the Red Sun, an Interregional offensive and defensive initiative. In other terms, we both occupy regions and defend natives from other occupiers should the need appear. Please check the dispatches below for further detail. When raiding or defending you are required to have a puppet in the World Assembly, so please transfer your World Assembly Status to your puppet or alt account nation. Orders will be posted below.
