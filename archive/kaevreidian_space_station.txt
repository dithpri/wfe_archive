The Kaevreidian Space Station is the largest man-made structure in existence. Housing Kaevreid&amp;#39;s population of 5 million, it was made from a lab-made material called Kaevroidites, allowing its metal form to be crafted (Kaevroid). It is slightly stronger than titanium-steel, ultra-cheap to create, has a very high melting point and reflects heat very efficiently. Although, a Kaevreidian Embassy exists on Earth, where old world Moscow, Russia, existed.
