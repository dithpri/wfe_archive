Welcome to Catasia! A gaggle of small islands off the coast of Thedas, formed hundreds of thousands of years ago by the violent eruption of a mega volcano that spewed firey cats for miles. Upon landing on their feet, the cats began to reproduce excessively and when our ancient foremothers found the islands, the cats taught them how to farm. FROM THERE, THE REST IS HISTORY.
