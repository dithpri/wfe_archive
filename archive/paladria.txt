After years of blood shed in the Old Land, the region saw a cease fire when in a coup d&amp;#39;etat, lead by [nation]Pouyastan[/nation], created the large continent of Paladria. Decades later, more regions began to appear, as the massive super-continent&amp;#39;s lands divided and gained independence. 
What started out as large conflict of interest, gave birth to the newer, modern life in this region. The founder, Pouyastan, is exempt from being the WA delegate as it must choose the Electoral Overseer.
