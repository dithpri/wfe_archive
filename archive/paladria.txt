After years of blood shed between the Old Kingdoms, the region saw a bright light at the end of the tunnel, showing human compassion and peace. Decades later, more regions began to appear, as the massive super-continent&amp;#39;s lands divided and gained independence. 
What started out as full on brawl, gave birth to the newer, modern life in this region. The founder, Pouyastan, gladly accepts the sharing of power within the region.
However, during the PMI6 (Pouyastan Military Intelligence, 6th echelon) breach in 2023 and the government&amp;#39;s quick finger pointing, the times of peace and compassion were perturbed. Pouyastan begun the incident by blaming the nation of Lochley. The WA delegate at the time, Assail, frowns upon the actions of Pouyastan.
