RH Political Science Region. We believe in a strong economy and government where every citizen contributes to the success of the whole. Personal freedom is good as long as it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt the whole and abide to the law. The political freedoms are outlawed, the government makes the best decisions possible for its citizens&amp;#39; benefit. Citizens enjoy great civil/personal freedoms and all contribute to their government. It&amp;#39;s a win-win situation for everyone. We support those who support us and demolish those in our way. WE&amp;#39;RE THE BEST, SO DON&amp;#39;T MESS.
