The Mariana Islands

Founded in 2018, the archipelago is currently led by Torresia, a nation formerly spawned from The North Pacific, and stayed there since the 18th of January. It seceded because of malcontent among the nation&#39;s bureaucrats. The Mariana Islands became a newly sprouted region since then.

The region is still underdeveloped at the time of the creation of this entry, and so much has been left to be desired.
