This region has been protected and preserved by the forces of [nation]Northern Mount Celestia[/nation]!

While browsing through my substantial (if I do say so myself) Ultra-rare card collection, I came across a card whose region no longer existed. In order to thank that nation (I have two copies of their card) for having a cool card, I&#146;ve preserved this region in their honor. If at any time they want a refound, they can TG my main account [nation]Northern Mount Celestia[/nation].
