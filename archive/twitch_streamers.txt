[region]The Black Hawks[/region] took flight once again today, to finally slay the evil Mindflayer, so it may never return. Fighting off its many heinous minions was difficult, so we swooped through this region to make sure it wasn&#39;t hiding here, briefly used a health potion, and then continued our attack run!

Through their many skills, a set of +3 Plate Mail, and a cool natural 20, the brave Hawks destroyed the Mindflayer, so that nobody would ever have to deal with it again.
