[b][u]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b][/u]

[color=red]Fash, please...if you&#39;re going to create regions like this, pretending to have captured the mighty and awesome [region]Antifa[/region], then at least keep control of your fake conquest.

Confiscated from its fascist owner on 31st May 2012, by [region]The Union of Nations Against Fascism[/region].[/color]

---------------------------------------------------

[color=blue]Protected in memory of the [region]The Union of Nations Against Fascism[/region] concept, whilst also highlighting the failure of then Nazi [nation]Captain Woodhouse[/nation]. His attempt to infiltrate the [region]Antifa[/region] network failed and over 50 regions were handed over to [region]The MT Army[/region].[/color]
