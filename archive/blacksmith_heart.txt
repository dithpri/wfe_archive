Transylvania is a historical region in the central part of Romania. Bounded on the east and south by the Carpathian mountain range, historical Transylvania extended in the west to the Apuseni Mountains; however, the term sometimes encompasses not only Transylvania proper, but also the historical regions of Cri&amp;amp;#351;ana, Maramure&amp;amp;#351;, and Romanian part of Banat.
The region of Transylvania is known for the scenic beauty of its Carpathian landscape and its rich history. In the English-speaking world it has been strongly associated with vampires,[1][2][3] chiefly due to the influence of Bram Stoker&amp;#39;s novel Dracula as well as its later film adaptations and extensions.
