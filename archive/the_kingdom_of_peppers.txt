Welcome to [region]The Kingdom of Peppers[/region] where [nation]SpongeBob NationPants[/nation] became WA Delegate of [region]The Black Riders[/region] for 6 hours.  He currently resides here, peacefully. 

This is the kingdom where [b]peppers[/b] flourish in every backyard garden. 
All you see are peppers and more peppers. 

[b]WARNING:[/b]

This region is [i]not[/i] a region that will be raided just because one wants to gain WA Delegate status. If anyone happens to take action of gaining WA Delegate position, you will be banned and ejected immediately.  This region is made so other nations can gather to raid other regions; similar to The Black Riders. If it continues, I will take further action and RAID your region....Bwahaha

This region is [b]raid[/b] free.
