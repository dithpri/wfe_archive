I have currently made this region, frontier, not by mistake, or accident, not for personal gain. I made it frontier so that it can grow naturally, so that it can grow together. I made it a frontier so that the people come first.

this region is currently still a big work in progress, with end goals to result in a better region for the whole of the world. This can all be helped along with your help. Want to help build the region?


LUP forever!
