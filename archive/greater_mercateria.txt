A Certified Copy of The Charter of the Greater Mercaterian League (Treaty of Lagobel) can be accessed [url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=297087]here.[/url] Signed and ratified initially by the eight nations (Manchovia, Voltrovia, Far Iplutian Provinces, Golachia, Ethrandiar, Mayerton, Thurbistan and Tovratis) in 1954, all Greater Mercaterian Nations have now ratified this charter and belong to the League, with the exceptions of Ombrathia, which never joined, and Cothmorgia, which was suspended in 2014. The primary author was Manchovia, while Voltrovia provided guidance.

The Mercaterian Collective Defence and Security Treaty (Maltrovis Pact) is shortly to be completed, and all members of the region will have to abide by its obligations. Any questions on this can be directed to Voltrovia!
