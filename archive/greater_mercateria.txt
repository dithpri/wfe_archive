A Certified Copy of The Charter of the Greater Mercaterian League (Treaty of Lagobel) can be accessed [url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=297087]here.[/url] Signed and ratified initially by the eight nations (Manchovia, Voltrovia, Far Iplutian Provinces, Golachia, Ethrandiar, Mayerton, Melicizen, Thurbistan and Tovratis) in 1954, all Greater Mercaterian Nations have now ratified this charter and belong to the League. The primary author was Manchovia, while Voltrovia provided input and guidance.

The Mercaterian Collective Defence and Security Treaty (Maltrovis Pact) is shortly to be completed, and, per previous discussions, all members of the region will have to abide by its obligations. Any and all questions on this can be directed to Voltrovia, who will be more than eager to answer them!
