The Royal Monarchial Confederation is a collection of member kingdoms that all work together to make the government and region a better place.

We like to roleplay, are very kind, and try our best to be as fair as possible.

The RMC does however have a few things for you to bear in mind:
- We are anti nazi, but are fine with custom made nations with tyrannical or fascist ideologies. Mass murder is not okay.
- We are kind to everyone unless you are unkind to us. You get what you give!

We want you to have as much fun as possible here.
