Our Glorious Holy Empire may be ruled by his Majesty, the Emperor; but it is still a chain of command that keeps even the lowest of criminals in check, or the farthest of villages. Any Officer, given the chance, may even amount up to a Baron one day. Enlist in the Imperial Legion, or Imperial Politics, and serve his Majesty and our Empire with a fierce determination, loyalty, and bravery!

Hail the Empire! Hail the Emperor!!
