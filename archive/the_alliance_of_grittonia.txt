The Alliance of Grittonia is a friendly region filled with great nations, all different and unique. Come on in and enjoy the place, we always have some room left and we don&amp;#39;t discriminate against any kind of nation.

[b]All may join! [/b] [i]However, if you&amp;#39;d be so nice to send a TG to the Founder (me) before coming in, that&amp;#39;d be massive. Peace and Love - Grittonia [/i]

Any region with a embassy in the Alliance of Grittonia can be seen as a official ally of the Alliance of Grittonia.
