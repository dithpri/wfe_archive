Welcome to the Comfort Cabin!
A shelter from the bad!
A mansion headed by The Great Union.
Raided by the black hawks twice.
Lay on our ultra comfy pillows!
Eat from our snack bar!
Always watch our television!
A region of railroad crossing.
Do not spam.
Do not do any bad things.
If you do these, you will be kindly asked to leave.
So make your self at home.
Recruit people and stay!
I am begging of you.
