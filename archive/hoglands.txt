[b]The Hoglands[/b]

The vast landmass now commonly known as the Hoglands was discovered in the final years of the 15th century. Over the course of the next several hundred years, the continent became a battleground for colonial empires and native populations fighting over its rich resources. Now, in the 21st century, the Hoglands form the heart of the global economy and are a diverse melting pot of cultures.

[b]The goal of the [region]Hoglands[/region] is to create a small, but coherent world based primarily around (post-)colonial faux-Americas in the in-universe equivalent of modern day.[/b]
