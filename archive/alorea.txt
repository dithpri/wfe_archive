Wellcome to Aloria, home of the Alorn people, protector of the guardians of the Orb of Aldur.

And thus was wrought, the hall of the Revan king, and thus his throne, and thus was forged his sword. And ever after were the descendents of Reva, marked with the mark of the orb upon the palm of their hands, and the manchild who would become king was borne at his birth onto the throne chamber and the hand that was so marked, was placed upon the orb that it might know him and destroy him not when he came into his inheritance. And with each such joining, did the bond between the orb of Aldur and the line of Reva, become stronger. And the orb waxed with brilliance with each infant touch, as if it rejoiced that the line remained unbroken.
