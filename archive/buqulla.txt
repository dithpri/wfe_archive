Buqulla is a tapered, wedge like region from east to west. The far east, wide and desolate, is all under the control of Super State Qabakh. As the region becomes thinner and more westerly, it turns into rolling hills, peninsulas and better arable land filled with many states. The region is locked in a cold war between the extreme pro-capitalist states and the Socialist states. The central plain, a breadbasket region on the western border of Qabakh seems to be the focal point of this cold war: Qabakh wants to seize this land for itself and gain an economic and material boost whilst simultaneously preventing a joint invasion from this land. The other states completely oppose Qabakh&#39;s right to do so.
