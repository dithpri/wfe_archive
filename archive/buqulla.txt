Buqulla is a region that consists of three countries. [color=blue]Rahzvan[/color], the western country, known for being the most liberal of the three, [color=red]Crotoshka[/color], stuck in the middle, this mostly rural nation has just come through a bloody civil war, and finally to the east [color=olive]Qabakh[/color], the seat of power due to its high amount of money, but its ideals clash with those of the other two countries. It has immense poverty and is situated within a desert. An unlikely alliance, but a necessary one. Due to the large amount of unclaimed land in Buqulla, new countries spring up all the time.
