[/b][/color]

[i]The Kingdom of the Kentish was an early medieval kingdom in what is now South East England. It is said to have been founded at an unknown date in the 5th century by Jutes, members of a Germanic people from continental Europe. It was one of the seven traditional kingdoms of the so-called Anglo-Saxon heptarchy, but it lost its independence in the 8th century when it became a sub-kingdom of Mercia. In the 9th century, it became a sub-kingdom of Wessex, and in the 10th century, it became part of the unified Kingdom of England that was created under the leadership of Wessex.[/i]
