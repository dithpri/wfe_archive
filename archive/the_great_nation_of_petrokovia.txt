Headed by Premier Daniel Petit, citizens of The United Soviet States of Petrokovia take much pride in their country. The weather is generally nice, though the winters can be harsh. Many of Petrokovia&amp;#39;s people compare their country to its national animal-the bear-in terms of strength and prowess. 
This is the region for Petrokovia and the majority of it&amp;#39;s RPing friends.
