Headed by Premier Daniel Petit, citizens of The United Socialist States of Petrokovia take much pride in their country. The weather is generally nice, though the winters can be harsh. Many of Petrokovia&amp;#39;s people compare their country to its national animal-the bear-in terms of strength and prowess. This is the location of Petrokovia and its allies.

The regional currency is the Euro. If you have not switched over to it, make sure you do that.
