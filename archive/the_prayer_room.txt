Inspirational Quote of the Month:
We need to find God, and he cannot be found in noise and restlessness. God is the friend of silence. See how nature &#150; trees, flowers, grass &#150; grows in silence; see the stars, the moon and the sun, how they move in silence&#133; We need silence to be able to touch souls.
&#150; Mother Teresa
