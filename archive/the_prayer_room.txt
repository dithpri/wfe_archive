A region I founded long ago that I have decided to refound. This will be a quiet spiritual place.

There will be a special position for the embassies officer. (Only three officers will be allowed embassies authority: the founder, the delegate, and the foreign affairs minister/embassies officer.) I don&#39;t want this region to collect random embassies. I want the embassies we build to be built intentionally and mindfully with quiet, peaceful, and/or spiritual regions.
