IGA is devoted to tracking down possible threats of the Reich. All criminals of the Reich will be tracked and found. We are determined to bring our enemies and those accused of wrong doings to Justice. IGA has been around for a long time but we were a secret society of the Reich that did not have its own region but had its agents and that was all that was needed. Most of our agents as ordered have never opened their mouth about this agency. We will remain commited to our work.&lt;br&gt;
