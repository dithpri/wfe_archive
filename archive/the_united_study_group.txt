[color=black]Occupied by [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qB1kp9adYYE]The Black Riders[/url]! Our lair can be found [/color] [url=http://s4.zetaboards.com/The_Black_Riders/index/]here[/url]

After an occupation that lasted for weeks, the efforts of The Eternal Knights were all in vain when Sergeant [nation=short]Volanowsh[/nation] of [region]The Black Riders[/region] descended upon the region and grabbed it from the clutches of the hopeless knights.

May this be a lesson to all those who dare stand in the face of [region]The Black Riders[/region].
