[hr][spoiler=Previous WFE][color=blue]People were tired of where they lived, so they used to go here DAMNIT![/color]

The capital was Study Room F. A place that branched dimensions, time space and realms. Species that inhabited the region were Humans, Dwyers, Mandalorians, Bystanders, Immortal Orange Frogs, Pugs and Intelligent Penguins.

This region is back under the control of its natives after an almost Two Year long Saga, but now we shall have peace. Natives may send tributary puppets to honor the region, but we do not seek to re-establish this as an active force.
