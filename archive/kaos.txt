A sunny region for vacancies, relax and discussions, where everybody is welcome.
As usual, our founder applies a policy of NO-SUPPRESSION and NO-EJECTION.
Of course, you will subject to NS rules here, as everywhere in NS, but our founder will not act against your ideas. This also apply to our enemies. 
This is the closest thing to free-speech that we can offer, and we are proud to offer it. 

EMBASSIES: not all embassies requests will be accepted. Only those from friends and from enemies  ;-)
