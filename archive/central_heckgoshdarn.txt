[b][u]Welcome to the [region]Central Heckgoshdarn[/region] region![/u][/b]

The region of Central Heckgoshdarn is an, albeit small, ideologically diverse collection of pacifist nations. Official member-nations are represented in the Regional Assembly, where region-wide policies are adopted. This institution has, however, no enforcing powers, leaving the policies&amp;#39; adoption to the member-nations&amp;#39; discretion.

[i]The nations of Central Heckgoshdarn are [b]proud[/b] to be [u]sovereign, and free of the World Assembly&amp;#39;s overbearing decisions.[/u][/i]
