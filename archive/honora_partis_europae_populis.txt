The HPEP (Honora Partis Europae Populis) is a leftist wing dedicated to advocating for European ideals and beliefs. We do not conduct offensive military excursions, however, we defend our allies to the bitter end.

Our Parliament will assume the Westminster style, with two houses. There will be five permanent ministries (Public Safety, Home Office, Environment, Labour, and Education), and each Prime Minister may appoint up to one (1) special portfolio to a JUNIOR minister only. 

All party affairs will be handled off-site, to prevent plans from being inadvertently disclosed to our enemies.
