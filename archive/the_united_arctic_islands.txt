The United Arctic Islands consist of free nations working together to build a better world.  We believe that government leadership and decisions should reflect a values that are firmly rooted in our belief in God, such as the sanctity of human life, the sanctity of marriage as established by God, the protection of the weak, and care of the poor, the orphans and the widows.
