Welcome to the Niyax Isles! This region is a military alliance that acts as a whole when someone in the region is attacked. Pretty much like NATO, but it&#39;s nations that have been ousted from their home regions, and can&#39;t find a place to belong. If you feel like you have experienced this, then this is the region for you. We&#39;ll take you under our wing, and make sure you&#39;ll be ensured safety. However, there&#39;s a couple of rules &amp; requirements that you must follow:

1. You must have at least Nipper Influence at the time of joining.
2. You must show decent civil rights, economy, or political freedom.
3. You must change your flag to a Niyax Warp. (See Member flags for reference.)
