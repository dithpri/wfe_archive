Starkiller Base was a First Order military base located on the ice planet of Ilum in the Unknown Regions. Commanded by an unofficial triumvirate of General Armitage Hux, Kylo Ren, and Captain Phasma, it was armed with a superweapon capable of destroying entire star systems halfway across the galaxy. The First Order viewed this ability as an evolution of the planet-destroying capabilities of the Galactic Empire&#39;s Death Star designs, with the weapon serving as the ultimate culmination of old Imperial research into dark energy translations and hyperspace tunneling.
