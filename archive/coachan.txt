Coachan&#39;s name derives from the Gaelic describing a beautiful feature in nature that is virtually hidden from sight.

Coachan is just that. A mountainous region enveloped in nature within a ringed fortress of mountains and seemingly hidden from the rest of the world.

We believe that when Nature and Technology co-exist a secure, altruistic, and wealthy nation will grow!
