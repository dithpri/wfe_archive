[b][i]The Lupercan Community[/i][/b] is a broad region of diverse landscapes and climates and equally diverse cultures united by a common origin: their ancestors and legendary founders of nations come all from the [i]Valley of Luperca[/i](now occupied by the Federal Republic of Luperca). Just was this nation that decided to start this cultural and economic community whose goals are to preserve the peace between these nations, international trade and the distribution of the surrounding areas. The cooperation was not an easy process but eventually the countries reached an agreement and signed the Pact of Luperca, in that city, which led to the organization of the regional community.
Long Live Lupercan Community! Prevail over all regions!
