The Diagonal Pacific usually worships peanut butter, but mostly the majestic phone book. The Diagonal Pacific is also great because of our peanut butter. We also love peanut butter, and it&amp;#39;s against the law not to eat at least 305 grams of peanut butter at every meal. Join the Diagonal Pacific!
P.S.-I like peanut butter
