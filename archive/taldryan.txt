Taldryan is one of the five Houses of the [url=http://wiki.darkjedibrotherhood.com/view/Dark_Jedi_Brotherhood]Dark Jedi Brotherhood[/url], currently led by Quaestor Rian Aslar and Keirdagh Taldrya Cantor. Formerly one of the seven Clans, Taldryan has an immense legacy based on the glorious victories of its past. For over a decade, Taldryan remained undefeated in the Great Jedi Wars, and had amassed a fleet that, at one time, rivaled that of the Dark Council&amp;#39;s. Many of its former leaders became prestigious members of the Council in roles ranging from Tribunes to the seat of Grand Master, helping to guide the entire Brotherhood to greatness.
