We have several departments developing and building grandeur items in hopes of a better future:

Happiness Department: 
A recent acquisition of over 10,000 Kittens
Sadness Department: 
A recent acquisition of over 10,000 dead kittens as they all died during the transportation.
Infrastructure Department:
A team of 2,500 builders planted several hundred signs that read: Do not read this sign.
Military Department:
Over 14 trillion dollars of taxpayers money are currently being targeted at a revolutionary weapon, a slightly curved, yellowish, potassium rich grenade that splits into a multitude of mini grenades. We estimate 55-95 health points taken away from each hostile damaged. Absolutely devastating.
