Welcome to [region]Seblarian Quarantine Space[/region]!

This region was created by the hallowed nation of [nation]New Eberron[/nation] as a neutral quarantine space for the region of [region]Seblaria[/region] and pretty much anyone else during Z-Day and anything else that might, for some reason, require a secure location for your entire country. [region]Seblarian Quarantine Space[/region] is also used as a puppet storage region for [region]Alnobia[/region], the unified region between [region]Seblaria[/region] and [region]Greater Catopia[/region]. 

We&#39;ll accept all embassy requests! [b][i][u]well, not now, because this will die soon[/u][/i][/b]

[b][i][u]this region is going to be deleted due to the name, and if you have any better ideas telegram them to me ([nation]New Eberron[/nation]) please![/u][/i][/b]
