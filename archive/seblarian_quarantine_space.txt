Welcome to [region]Seblarian Quarantine Space[/region]!

This region was created by the hallowed nation of [nation]New Eberron[/nation] as a neutral quarantine space for the region of [region]Seblaria[/region] and pretty much anyone else during Z-Day and anything else that might, for some reason, require a secure location for your entire country. [region]Seblarian Quarantine Space[/region] is also used as a puppet storage region for [region]Seblaria[/region] and a region to have Seblarian polls for the unification process between Seblaria and [region]Greater Catopia[/region]. The dispatch with the list of potential names is posted here.
We&#39;ll accept all embassy requests unless specifically told otherwise by [region]Seblaria[/region].
