The Philippine Union is a medium-sized region decided by its founding members, Filipinas Kanluran and Filipinas Silangan, as the breeding ground of independence and acceptance in NationStates.

Built this October 2016, this region is built in the idea of respect for the actions of its fellow nations. No restrictions for those who want to join even for those who has a different ideology from the rest of the region.

Come on, join us! And let us unite as one, and united.
