There once was a chicken, this chicken laid an egg. In this egg, there was another egg and another and another. When they finally reached the last egg, it was empty. Dissapointed by the lack of egg-treasure, the two men who found the egg threw it away into the ocean.
The next day, they awoke to find an island on the horizon, one that was not there before. This island had grown from the egg and continued to grow until it became the region of Squibland we know and love.
