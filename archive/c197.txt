C-197 is the primary dimension of Chris&#39; fantasy. The name is based off the fictional dimension of C-137 from Rick and Morty.[8] It includes CWCVille and all other creations Chris has produced over the years, as well as various creations by other companies and people, such as Transformers, My Little Pony and all manner of Sonichu OC, as well as non-Sonichu examples as well, though only conditionally. The geography of this dimension is dubious, with CWCVille itself behaving much like Springfield from The Simpsons, expanding and contracting as need arises.
