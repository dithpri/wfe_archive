
[b]Hello,[/b] we are Roses With Thorns
The land where warrior legends are born
Amidst the rolling hills and steppes
The calling of the goddess.

This, the land where old warriors pray
Overlooking the foes they&#39;re about to slay
Where the people of old, and the people of new
Gather around, to make friendships anew

But in this region, some rules apply
Dont harass others, or you will die
All are free to roam this land
We&#39;ll lend anyone a helping hand.

But nations who wish to settle here
Must beware of things that near
Expect propaganda as a way of life
Take it in with elegance and strife.

For those who want action, there&#39;s [region]Roses Without Thorns[/region]
With an active RMB and roleplay galore
But when you go, be sure to endorse Lethinia
Cause you will get a brand new Kia (jk) :)
