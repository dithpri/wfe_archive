[b]Welcome to The Conservative Coalition!

Once home to a vibrant conservative/libertarian community, we are banding together once again to return the region to its former glory. 
We represent nations who believe in at least one conservative ideal. We recognize that there are many kinds of conservatives and we welcome them all. We do not impose beliefs on our members and encourage debate about the issues.***
