[b]Welcome to the CC![/b]

This region, founded in 2008, was once home to a vibrant, tight-knit community and has since fallen from prominence. It now serves as a monument to the memory of the friends made and good times shared.

If you plan to stick around, please endorse our World Assembly Delegate, [nation=short]NicoPaulLand[/nation] and feel free to contact him with any questions or concerns.
