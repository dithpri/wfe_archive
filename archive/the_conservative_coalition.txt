[b]Once home to a vibrant conservative/libertarian community, our few remaining members reside here in peace. While no longer an active region, several founding nations and prominent leaders remain. We enjoy simply being here and occasionally talking shop about the issues of the day, feel free to join in - we welcome interesting conversation.[/b]

[color=#D31E1E][b]Please note, that while we are no longer an active region we maintain sovereignty over the region through our Stewards, WA Delegate and Founder. Please contact any of the Stewards/WA Delegate if you have any questions regarding our region. [/b][/color]

[b]All WA Nations are asked to endorse the WA Delegate [nation]GraySoap[/nation][/b]
