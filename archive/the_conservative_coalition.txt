[b]Welcome to [color=navy]The Conservative Coalition[/color][/b], once home to a small but vibrant community of friends. Founded in 2008 by players from various similarly themed regions, the CC hosted many competitive elections and an ever-developing body of law. A few years later, many of its most notable contributors had moved on to larger communities or from NationStates itself. Today, the CC exists as little more than a monument to the friendships forged here those many years ago. Please feel welcome to share memories and well-wishes on the regional message board!
