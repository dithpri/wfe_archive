As you take in the beautiful scenery of Bujibroisha, you get a great view of the town below you. You hail a taxi and think, &quot;Wow. This region truly is epic.&quot; 3 years later, as you go outside for a walk in the park, you start remembering how misty Bujibroisha&#39;s mornings are. You get to the park and see tons of wildlife along the trail. You know Bujibroisha is perfect.
