[color=White][b][u]Welcome to The New Front![/u][/b][/color]
We hope to give you a absolutely fantastic role-play environment here. We&amp;#39;ll be setting up the rules and the global map here soon. The beginning year is 2070, leaving tons of space for developing nations that are just a little more &amp;#39;techy&amp;#39; than modern ones. All nations will be going through our &amp;quot;Quality Control&amp;quot; as to make sure you&amp;#39;re not to advanced there. (Unit wise, technology wise) All calculations [color=red][u]WILL BE[/u][/color] based off of the [url=http://www.broomdces.com/nseconomy/] Nation States Calculator [/url]. Hope to finish these things up before we get heavy role-plays!
