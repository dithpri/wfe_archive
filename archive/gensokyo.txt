[b]MESSAGE FROM THE DELEGATE - FEBRUARY 18, 2014[/b]
Gensokyo is now open for business. Please go out there and recruit your fellow Touhou fans! Start wars, chat more, be active! I&amp;#39;ve admittedly been absent for quite some time, but I want to turn this region into something worth checking every day, something exciting and interesting, and I can&amp;#39;t think of a better group of people to do it.

All nations are strongly encouraged to endorse [nation]Konataland[/nation] for the security of our region.

(For entry to Gensokyo, please PM the regional delegate.)
