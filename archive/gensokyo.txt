[b]TERRA REGUM IMPERATORUMQUE TOTUM MUNDUM REGET

This raid was brought to you by [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region], and will form a temporary part of our expanding empire.

One fenda was being mean to me. Stupid baka! So I booted him.  I hope Onder-Senpai noticed me today! 

Also a personal thanks to the super-kawaii region of [region]The Kingdom of Denmark[/region] for helping us out on this raid![/b]
