It&#39;s been almost 2 years since I started NS, a far cry from the decades of experience that many veterans have. Things were all good until the beginning of 2019, when I fatefully resigned and officially cut all ties with The Invaders. Hartfelden sheltered me and let me breath. Until I made mistakes and now, all the progress that I had made is worthless. I am now in a list of players, the worst of the worst, and I have no further reason to pursue anything. No reason to pursue justice, global politics, anything. 

May the memory of Conquerus live on, whether positive or not.
