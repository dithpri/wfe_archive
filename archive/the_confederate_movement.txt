On March 21, 2012, a small redneck family, riddled with incest, know for their prolific laziness, broadcasted to the world the truth, &amp;quot;the south will rise again.&amp;quot; With the humble name of, &amp;quot;Duck Dynasty,&amp;quot; these brave souls are standing up for the horribly oppressed, racially profiled people of the south who just want to, &amp;quot;give dem goddam Yankees the business.&amp;quot; One year after this spark of revolution finally the South is succeeding. Countries are sprouting up everywhere to help aid them in their endeavor. Please help me, help all of us beat these Yankees and reclaim the South, all it takes is one click and you can join The Confederate Movement.
