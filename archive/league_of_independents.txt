The League of Independents stands for self-governing countries, honorably exempt from greater powers and spheres of influence. 
Within the League, it is expected for states to practice governing for only their own country, as to maintain the integrity in our mission.

&quot;Keep your dirty fingers out of our (similarly corrupt) governments!&quot;
