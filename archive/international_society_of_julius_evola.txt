[color=blue][b]Julius Cesare Andrea Evola was a mystical man of transcendental enlightenment. Evola lived during a time of chaos and unrest. He served in World War I as an artillery officer and spent the postwar years as an artist and philosopher of traditionalism. Throughout his life, he overcame brutal circumstances and disability to become one of the most revered radical philosophers of the 20th century.[/b][/color]

[b]The Society, in accordance with Evola, stands opposed to all forms of modernity, such as liberal democracy, communism, capitalism, anarchism, and other forms of bourgeois and plebian dissolution.[/b][/i]
