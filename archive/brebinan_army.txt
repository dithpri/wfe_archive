[b]Wait, we&#39;re still doing this?
Congrats on being featured! Your present: a raid!!![/b]
Let&#39;s cut the chit-chat. Being associated with fascists and DoS nations is probably not a good idea, and to be governorless and featured makes it even worse. Also, most of your natives are in [region]Atlantiva[/region] anyway.
This raid brought to you by [region]The Revolutionary Initiative[/region].
