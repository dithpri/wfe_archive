This region, once a communist &quot;power&quot; and home to many scum, has been once again cleansed by [region]Farkasfalka[/region]n military forces. This region is now in the hands of a select few who will guard this region.

[b]Note: This is not an official Farkasfalkan colony. Farkasfalka no longer carries this colony, and has been refunded privately by [nation]Cossack Khanate[/nation]. 

Disclaimer: The aircraft used to refound this nation is now part of a wider task force. The Khanate does not take all responsibility for anything down with this puppet.[/b]
