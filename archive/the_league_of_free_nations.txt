[b][color=purple]Happy March, natives![/color] [hr]
We at Malice, along with our friends from [region]Astoria[/region], are celebrating the long awaited coming of spring, and have decided to spread our joy around, ending up in your region!
We might have celebrated a little bit too hard, sorry for the stained clothes. [color=purple]Purple[/color] is, however, one of the colors associated with [color=lime]spring![/color] We&#39;ll be seeing ya, [color=purple]the Overseer[/color] is always hungry for more celebrations!
