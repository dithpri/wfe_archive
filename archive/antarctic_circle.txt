The Antarctic Circle is a cold, quite region. It was founded so far from civilisation for the thought of invasion of such a remote location would be pointless. However because of its remoteness it is easier to build larger armies. The regional flag was chosen because of its background as well as the Animals pictured on the front showing care and support for natives or allies alike.
