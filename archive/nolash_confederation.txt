The Nolash Confederation is a confederation of nations of any type, all nations can elect the new Fim every 6 months, though the Uyumizhzhadhvu is in real power, the Uyumizhzhadhvu is the only position that has executive power, making it the real power in the confederation, since they are able to change the authorities of the Fim and the WA Delegate, and even make new positions.

If you become the Fim or WA Delegate, changing the flag is can only be done through a poll, where every nation can vote for a new flag. You can take polls anytime, and everything else is free to change, except for banning nations, when you ban nations, the Uyumizhzhadhvu will take a look at the nation to see if they deserve getting banned.
