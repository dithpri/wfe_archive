&quot;Hey look, buddy, I&#39;m an Engineer. That means I solve problems. Not problems like &#39;what is beauty?&#39;, because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy. I solve practical problems. For instance, how am I gonna stop some big mean mother hubbard from tearing me a structurally superfluous new behind? The answer: use a gun. And if that don&#39;t work? Use more guns. Like this heavy-caliber tripod-mounted little old number designed by me... built by me, and you best hope... not pointed at you.&quot;
