Risin&#39; up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I&#39;m back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times, it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don&#39;t lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive
