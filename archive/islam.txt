[b]Islam[/b] is a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion based upon the Qur&#39;an, a religious text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God (All&amp;#257;h), and, for the vast majority of adherents, by the teachings and normative example (called the sunnah, composed of accounts called hadith) of Muhammad (c. 570&#150;8 June 632 CE), considered by most of them to be the last prophet of God. 

With about 1.6 billion followers or 23 percent of the global population, Islam is the second-largest religion by number of adherents and, according to many sources, the fastest-growing major religion in the world. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
