[hr][b][color=#ED4719]This region has been occupied by the [region]Appalachian Empire[/region]![/b][hr]

A silly defender named [nation=short+noflag]0cala[/nation] forgot this region only had one puppet defending it, and moved that puppet over to [region]Artificial Solar System[/region] to engage in defender treachery, leaving this region vulnerable to capture. It is now protected from hate by the empire of [region]Appalachia[/region]![/color]
