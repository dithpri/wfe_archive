Consisting of Eastern nations, abundant of cultures and extraordinary history from the u-shaped valleys and soaring alps to the noble marshes, dense forests, hyaline lakes and verdant fields. Wars are ruthless and unforgiving, just as they should be with the traditional moral values cherished profoundly. The West is secluded from perception, this is the existence we live. Welcome to the East.
