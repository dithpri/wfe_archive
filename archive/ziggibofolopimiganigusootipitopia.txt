[B][i]The Elections Are Coming!![/i][/B]
By popular vote elections are to be held for regional positions, such as the town bum and minister of war.
Each vote will be held via regional poll, and each person may have only one vote (meaning you may only have 1 vote, even if you have multiple nations).
