We are an alliance dedicated to the protection and growth of Puppet Nations of all kinds. If you are a puppet nation, then you are welcome here. We love good jokes and we are very friendly except we dislike all non-puppet nations.

[color=blue]Question of the Month[/color]
-[i]Why [u]you[/u] should join The Alliance of Puppet Nations?[/i]
Did you know that most players in NationStates have multiple puppets? That means that you, the viewer right now, probably have a puppet nation that is looking for a new home. Why not bring it here? Join the alliance! Fight for all puppets! (Note: The statistics mentioned here are random guesses and may not reflect actual fact.)
