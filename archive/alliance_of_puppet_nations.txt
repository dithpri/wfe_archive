We are an alliance dedicated to the protection and growth of Puppet Nations of all kinds.
If you are a puppet nation, then you are welcome here. Anyone can take the WA position by simply being the most popular.
We are very friendly except we dislike all non-puppet nations.

[i]Why [u]you[/u] should join The Alliance of Puppet Nations?[/i]
Did you know that most players in NationStates have multiple puppets? That means that you, the viewer right now, probably have a puppet nation that is looking for a new home. Why not bring it here? Join the alliance! Fight for all puppets! (Note: The statistics mentioned here are random guesses and may not reflect actual fact.)
