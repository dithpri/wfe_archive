Welcome to Oakvale! 

This is a region dedicated to the fictional world of Albion, taking place shortly after the time of Fable 1. With Jack gone, people haven&#39;t had much to worry about. So cities have reverted to attacking other cities and towns to create new kingdoms.

In this region you can create a city or you can be in control of a bandit group, or even a wandering trader selling items. Although all Heroes can only be requested through the guild.
