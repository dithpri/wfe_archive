In ancient Greek religion and mythology, [b]Pan[/b] (/p&aelig;n/; Ancient Greek: &amp;#928;&amp;#940;&amp;#957;, romanized: [i]P&aacute;n[/i]) is the god of the wild, shepherds and flocks, rustic music and impromptus, and companion of the nymphs. He has the hindquarters, legs, and horns of a goat, in the same manner as a faun or satyr. With his homeland in rustic Arcadia, he is also recognized as the god of fields, groves, wooded glens, and often affiliated with sex; because of this, Pan is connected to fertility and the season of spring.
