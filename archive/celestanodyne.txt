Very uniquely, Celestanodyne keeps up with its motto with strict observance of truth and discipline. No Dictatorship Goverments with vices. We believe in freedom of every individual&amp;#39;s scientific talents, eternal, philosophical and artistic ideas and ideals, to achieve morality and seamless justice. The FACT is the world is not what it was supposed to be. Proving every individual, nation&amp;#39;s true worth together, the axioms and secrets and objectives of beyond-Universe, what one&amp;#39;s purpose on Earth was meant to be, while following peaceful and progressive policies. Highly intelligent nations  with scientific advancement and exuberance, spirituality and purity, 0% crime rates, ET nations and moderate economic strength are most welcome.
