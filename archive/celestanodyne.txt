The nations of Celestanodyne keep up with their motto with strict observance of truth and discipline. Dictatorship Goverments with vices are not allowed. We believe in freedom of every individual&amp;#39;s scientific talents, eternally philosophic and artistic ideas and ideals, to achieve morality and seamless justice while keeping in mind the FACT that the world is not what it was supposed to be, proving every individual, nation&amp;#39;s true worth together, the axioms and secrets and objectives of beyond-Universe, what one&amp;#39;s purpose on Earth was meant to be, while following peaceful and progressive policies. Nations with highly intelligent population, scientific advancement and exuberance, 0% crime rates and moderate economic strength are most welcome.
