All nations are allowed to partake in [color=blue]Empire[/color] operations, however nations that meet [color=blue]Drakonian Doctrine[/color] standards will be able to join the elite group of the [b][i]Ausw&auml;len[/i][/b]. In addition WA-member states are automatically granted a position in the [b][color=red]Unterwerfungritter[/color][/b], should they accept.
