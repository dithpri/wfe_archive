
Korbloxian society is organized into 12 tribes, with one in secret. They are based in the frozen wastes, a harsh, inhospitable land, uninhabitable to normal humans. They follow the Archlord, the deity of Necromancy. Below the Archlord is the General. Below the General is the Scourgelord and the Mage King. Below them are the 12 deathspeakers.

Korbloxians themselves are lithoids, former humans that adapted to their harsh surroundings, or are ice zombies who have been raised from the dead. They have been made more barbaric than their neighbors on the map, but this hasn&#39;t stunted their acquisition of knowledge.
