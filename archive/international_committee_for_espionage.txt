Welcome to the ICE.

The ICE is a joint initiative of international intelligence communities, represented by their respective member-states, to defend the member-states by shared intelligence and espionage initiatives.

All member-states of all diversities are welcome to join the ICE, and contribute to the defence of themselves and of other member-states.

There are no specific requirements in joining the ICE. Free speech is allowed in the Regional Message Board. Please respect all diversities from all member-states and remain respectful and co-operative.
