[*]After the old founder, [nation]Bluperium[/nation], CTEd, the region was raided by [region]The Black Hawks[/region]. While the remaining natives relocated to [region]The Concord of Nations[/region], the military of [region]Royal Assembly of the Third PCWZ Empire[/region] temporarily restored native control. Incursions by [region]Spear Danes[/region] resulted in the puppet of [nation]San Solano[/nation], the former Rank 1 Officer, being deposed from its office, hampering recovery efforts.
[*]After many months of this situation, the region was finally cleared out enough to permit a refound. TRN is now firmly under the protection and control of its successor, [region]The Concord of Nations[/region]. All former residents are encouraged to move there.
