Does what it says on the tin.

Embassy requests will sadly be ignored until they expire.  Ditches do not have embassies.  Graves do not have embassies.

I really am sorry about the embassy requests. I like embassy collectors.  Try [region]Eltranite Spoiled Puppies Network[/region], [region]LIA claimed lands[/region], [region]The Bannedlands[/region], or [region]Minor League Farm System[/region] instead.  I&#39;ll happily give you embassies there.

Unless you have your region tagged as fascist or invader. Then don&#39;t bother. I just reject those.
