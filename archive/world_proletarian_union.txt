Greeting, comrade. The World Proletarian Union (WPU) is a region intended as a bulwark of Marxist Socialism against reactionary capitalist, imperialist, and fascist powers. Though we oppose all exploitation and oppression, our primary concern is the liberation of the working class, and wresting of power from the greedy international banks and corporations.
