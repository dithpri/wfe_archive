[B][color=Gold]GLORIA IN EXCELSIS![/color]

Global Lancemen of the Realms Imperial United

Military of [region]Sovereign Imperial Realms[/region][/B]
[i]And so begins the nightmare hour,
Dead to thee, I offer a flower,
The enemy of mine shall duck and cower,
With my feet kicked up in my office tower.

Lancemen gained glory tonight
Yes we will give you the fight.
I only see what is just and right,
From Machina, our guiding light.

GLORIA give and GLORIA take,
The enemies heads on the stake.
Our name shall ring from land to lake
Perfection only, no mistake.[/i]
