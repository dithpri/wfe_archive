Wanted by the nazi&amp;#39;s over in antifa?
Are the raiders and fenda&amp;#39;s on you about your dissident work against them?
Are you just looking for a place to stay, still lush and undeveloped, with a good economy and low taxes?

No, were not Republicans (mainly libertarians, if anything). We want you for our community. We do levy a small tax, but the protection, the community, and the beautiful scenery are worth it. 
Contact me, Ravineworld for tax info, real estate values, and the other info you&amp;#39;ll need to move to the beautiful community here in tea party movement.
Currently, I have an immigration quota of 10 nations and 8 properties for sale. We accept puppets as currency.
