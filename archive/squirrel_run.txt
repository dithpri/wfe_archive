[i]Welcome to Squirrel Run, a culturally significant region for The D&aacute;xlamic Empire. [/i]

[b][u]HISTORY[/u][/b]
The Socialist Plebeian Republic of [nation]Randovia[/nation], once the primary nation of Dux Bradford John of [nation]New Bradfordsburg[/nation], served as the founder of this region in 2004 before joining the region of New Sparrow. Squirrel Run had a brief existence, between the first and second griefings of [region]Sparrow[/region]. 

Randovia was deleted in the Second Griefing of Sparrow, and Squirrel Run became founderless. The region soon went defunct when New Bradfordsburg was founded and opted towards a reunification period of positive relations that lasted years with Sparrowivan ex-pats in [region]New Sparrow[/region].

[i]This region is now administered by The D&aacute;xlamic Empire, administered by New Bradfordsburg.[/i]
