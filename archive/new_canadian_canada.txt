Welcome to New Canadian Canada: The Region!

I hope you enjoy your time here!

I have very few rules for how I govern my region, in fact I only have three, they are:

You must have started with a Socialist Government
You must be Canada themed
You must be classified as an Inoffensive Centrist Democracy

If you do not abide by these rules, [b]you shalt be banished from mine region![/b]

[u]HAVE A NICE DAY![/u]
