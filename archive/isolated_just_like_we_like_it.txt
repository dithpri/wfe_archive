[b][color=teal]The Psychotic Dictatorship of [nation]Marty Brown[/nation][/color][/b]
[i]&quot;Irreverence Towards All&quot;[/i]

[nation]Marty Brown[/nation] is ruled with an iron fist by its eponymous leader, who governs without fear or favour. The government is enormous, corrupt, and highly efficient, balancing the demands of Defence, Law &amp; Order, and Administration. All private enterprise is outlawed, and the state controls every aspect of economic and social life. Citizens are affectionately referred to as &quot;my little playthings,&quot; and the government is known for its irreverent approach, including phoning celebrities for state-sanctioned breeding programs.
