The [i] Mountain of Imminent Doom [/i] is a cool mountain, great for real estate. just don&amp;#39;t be bad, or you&amp;#39;ll meet your doom... Imminently. Still, we are a great region full of fast cars, fast food, fast women, and [b] fast fun![/b]

We don&amp;#39;t have a WA member, because it is a stupid idea. We believe in the mountain fhurer, who resides on the snow-capped peak of the mountain. [b][i] LONG LIVE THE MOUNTAIN FHURER!! [/b][/i]
