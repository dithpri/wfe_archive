A set of islands with connection to one giant mainland.

The mainland is blocked on all sides to naval transportation except on one spot, that area hosting a rainforest while being a perfect area for a dock.  Several varieties of fish occupy the seas, along with other native life in the lands.  An island is situated just left to the mainland, it being significant in that it is large and mostly frozen.
