The Nohrian Empire - A land full of dragons, magic, politics, and, of course, war!  Join the Nohrian Empire and take action in rping, discussion of the region, maybe an occasional raid or two, and more!  Any idea can be considered a great idea under the right circumstances, so why not show your brilliance off?  All we ask is you are on at least one a week (unless a reason is given) and you respect the authorities of the region so that actions may not be taken against you.  Thank you!
