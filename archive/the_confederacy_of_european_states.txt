[u]The Confederacy of European States[/u] is a union of independent European-based nations to gather in friendly discussion and debate. We are a region that promotes friendly and quality discussion and role-play, enabling all of our member nations to grow into an active international community. 

Feel free to share or seek advice, talk about national happenings, discuss politics, etc. in the thread below. We at the CES only ask that you be respectful to your fellow nations. 

We also encourage all member nations to claim territory on the map featured below. Form borders with fellow member states, bolstering the community.
