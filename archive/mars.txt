Welcome. Welcome to Mars. 
You have chosen, or been chosen, to relocate to one of our finest remaining solar colonies.
I thought so much of Mars that I elected to establish my administration here, in the Eye so thoughtfully provided by our benefactors.
I&#39;ve been proud to call Mars my home. And so, whether you are here to stay, or passing through on your way to parts unknown - welcome to Mars. It&#39;s braver here.
