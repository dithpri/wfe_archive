[b]Ladzi[/b] (/&amp;#621;&amp;#592;&amp;#712;&amp;#675;i/) (English: Universe) is the sphere of influence that encompasses the successors of Yaptan natives and their existing equivalent [nation]Yapta[/nation]. Not included is [nation]Fasma[/nation], which currently is under the sovereign protection of [nation]Diarcesia[/nation]. Due to long-term isolation and early hostile encounters with foreigners, nations within Ladzi tend to be highly xenophobic and idiosyncratic.
