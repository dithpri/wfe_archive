A region of great nations with powerful armed forces. This is a region of tolerance but not overly tough on rules as to what types of nations can join, as long as those nations do not seek to dominate or impose their will on other nations, this type of behavior will cause the offending nations to be ejected from the region with the force of a railgun.
&amp;quot;Although we, as a region, cherish and strive to protect the Freedom of speech, it does not grant freedom from consequence.  If any nation posts hatred or ill-deserved rebuke, there will most certainly be consequences.&amp;quot;
