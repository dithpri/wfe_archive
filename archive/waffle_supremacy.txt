Approximately half a million years ago, an unknown meteor fell through the sky of west Bardon... the Broarydians and the Vulxoians immediately went to search it and fell in love with the unknown type of food that came with it. They later named it &quot;Waffle&quot;, which is still being prayed to every day by the people in Bardon. They later created an region called &quot;Waffle Supremacy&quot;.
