[i]&quot;The planet of Jelid is the paragon of natural selection.. there is no latitude for error or failure to adapt. Only the most audacious and adroit of men dare consider survival a reality. Life is quite sparse in the frigid world of Jelid, but men adapt... just as all organisms must do. However, in such a hellish place the threshold between man and predator grows rather tenuous.. Yes, Jelid was made by God to test the faithful.[/i]
