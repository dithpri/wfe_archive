The North Pacific Army has targeted this region due to its ties with The Confederation of Corrupt Dictators (CCD). CCD is a fascist region that has violated the sovereignty of The North Pacific and this is part of the consequence. The North Pacific Army will continue to target regions that partner with or ally with CCD.
