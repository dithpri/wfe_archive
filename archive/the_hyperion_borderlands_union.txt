Handsome Jack and The Hyperion Borderlands Union welcomes you.

&quot;..This guy rushes me with a spoon. A fricking spoon. And I&#39;m just laughing. So I scoop out his eyeballs with it, and his kids are all, &quot;aghhhhh!,&#148; and, ah...you had to be there. Anyway, the moral is: you&#39;re a bitch.&quot;

 The World Assembly is full of  bandits who just want to waste what is in those sweet vaults!  So why not join the only region who will give you what you want !  Money , Power, Guns guns and Your own Claptrap. 
The Hyperion Borderlands Union is always wanting new members to climb the Corporate ladder and give Handsome Jack some one new to shoot .. I mean help and mould in his vision ( don&#39;t tell him I said that .. please ) .

All Embassies welcome.. sort of ...
