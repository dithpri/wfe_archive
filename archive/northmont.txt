The country of Northmont is a cluster of islands
Bordered between wasteland to the North, a glacier to the South, huge mountains to the East and a huge sea to the West, The Northmont Region Lives off the Corporate Police State 

The people of Northmont are selfish towards foreigners and tend to welcome them with sarcasm. They feel foreigners could prohibit the Region&#39;s well being
The Northmont Region has tough laws and corrupt law enforcement, which is expected in their circumstances. The people are hostily due to questionable safety, caused by lost skills and Corporate Warfare.
