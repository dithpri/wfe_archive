Welcome to the small and growing beautiful region of Morbekia. We have vast forest &amp; wood-lands. A place where fairy folk &amp; unicorns roam freely. When you visit, or decide to move here. We ask you treat everyone here with respect. Morbekia welcomes all peaceful nations into our region. You&#39;re encourage to join the WA. But the members who have look after those who haven&#39;t. We guard and defended Morbekia. And always will.. This is a safe &amp; happy place. And we want to keep it that way. Again we warmly welcome all visitors &amp; new Nations
