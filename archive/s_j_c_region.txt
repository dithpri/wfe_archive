St. John&#146;s Region is a community dedicated to liberal education. It seeks to free nations from the tyrannies of unexamined opinions and inherited prejudices. 
Freedom is pursued mainly through thoughtful conversation about great books of the Western tradition. The books that are at the heart of learning at St. John&amp;#39;s stand among the original sources of our intellectual tradition. They not only illuminate the persisting questions of human existence, but also have great relevance to contemporary problems. They change our minds, move our hearts, and touch our spirits.
