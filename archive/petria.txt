Welcome to [b]Petria[/b], a region founded in honour of the Apostle Saint Peter.

This Region was first a temporary shelter for Catholic Nations which where at the time homeless, being the [region]Coalition of Catholic States[/region] their Motherland. 
When the time arrived, some of the greatest Nations chose to remain and establish permanently in this wonderful region, gaining independence and raising a new structure of power shaped in some new shared interests.

All Nations -especially the Catholic ones- are invited to come and to stay if you find that our principles are good.
