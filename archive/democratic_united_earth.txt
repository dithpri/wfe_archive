[color=blue][b]Welcome to Democratic United Earth, the first URCR-Lardy Colony. although the Interdimensional Community will recieve a special treatment. we will run this region democratically as it was supposed to be, all the users that left this region after the raid can return home. we won&#39;t judge you, also the people who are still here are now citizens of the URCR. so you can now have the same benefits, if you want you can even join Lardyland or the URCR if you like![/b][/color]
