The United Unaudited States are a tax free haven, where anything...and we mean anything goes. Member states are free to pursue any political philosophy they wish and hunt any animal to extinction. Our most precious commodity is Southern Steel, both for its monetary value and for its nutritional value. Our national pastime is drinking straight Tabasco sauce, and eating phone books is the leading cause of death. We militantly support William Shatner.
