In 2025, the nations of Earth entered WWIII when North Korea, tired with westerner interference launched its nuclear arsenal at the United States, United Kingdom and Germany. The subsequent ten years were a period of immense turmoil which ended in a century long period known as &quot;The Great Darkness&quot;. This period of time was once of no world powers, most of it was without power or large militaries. Now it is the year 2135 and nations have finally begun reforming and the technology has once again reached a early 2000&#39;s level but fossil fuels are low and nations must now rely more heavily on green energy which drastically cuts down on the military machine.
