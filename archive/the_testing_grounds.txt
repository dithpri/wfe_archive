Our purpose: To consolidate the puppets of a very specific group of players to enable the testing of themes and/ or ideological radicality, without disrupting the primary region in which the player&amp;#39;s main nation resides. In other words, The Testing Grounds is used to declutter another region by removing the flood of puppets that would otherwise be diluting the primary region&amp;#39;s effectiveness and cohesiveness. We hope you enjoy your stay. Or not. Your choice.
