[u][B]Mission Statement:[/B][/u]
We serve as a way-station, a puppet dump, as anything you need. Need to hide you raider-ness by stopping in neutral regions? Feel free. Don&#39;t want anyone knowing the strange and twisted things your puppets do? Move them here. Want a completely empty rmb with no idle chatter? *A silent moment of consent follows* Don&#39;t care about your nation and want it to die in hiding? Retire here. And remember, Industry is your friend.
[B][u]Update:[/u][/B]
We are now officially open to the general public. If you need to store your puppets or test out some less ...conventional ideologies, then this is the region for you.
