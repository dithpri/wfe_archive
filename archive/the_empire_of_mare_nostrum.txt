Hello Mare Nostrum,
It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve made an announcement. As some of you may have already noticed, the region has been password locked. The reason for this is that the leadership here no longer has the time to commit to this region effectively. So with heavy hearts, we have decided to put an end to the Empire of Mare Nostrum.
We&#39;ve been around for over a year now, and we&#39;ve had some great times. While not all of you were along for the ride the entire time, I want to thank each of you for being a part of this region.

As the third and final Emperor of Mare Nostrum,
The End
