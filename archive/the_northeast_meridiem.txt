The Northeast Meridiem is a harsh land with conflicting ideologies and economies. The nations of the region are regularly on edge with a short fuse, with the risk of destroying their shared land being the only thing that keeps the peace. Trade between these bitter rivals only really exists out of necessity, not bonds. The Northeast Meridiem is epitomized by large rolling hills, thick conifer forests, and eroded mountains that pierce through the canopy. Originally inhabited by the Qamotandiv indigenous tribe, these stewards of the forest protected the rich and vibrant Meridiem until 10 years ago, refugees fleeing from civil war founded Mortlaner in an attempt to start a new life, causing other settlers to follow suit.
