Greetings 

we are a group of Nations  that share Islamic beliefs and culture. We are independent Nations who treat each other with respect and work together. To join, Nations should have a good number of Muslim citizens and agree to our basic rules.

Long story short? This is a laid back region, we don&#39;t expect anything from anyone, and we won&#39;t expect anything from anyone, whether it is a nation or a region, and we are way too far from being politically active so don&#39;t even think about it

Want to see what we&#39;re about? [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=2546212]Take a quick tour[/url]. We hope you&#39;ll consider being part of our Islamic Continent!

NOTE: [region]Islamic continent[/region] and [region]the Islamic continent[/region] are two different regions due to a raid  that happened in [region]Islamic continent[/region]
