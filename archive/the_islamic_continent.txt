Greetings 

Welcome to [region]the Islamic Continent[/region], successor to [region]Islamic continent[/region]. we are a group of Nations  that share Islamic beliefs and culture. We are independent Nations who treat each other with respect and work together. To join, Nations should have a good number of Muslim citizens and agree to our basic rules.

Here in our region, we talk, work on things together, and help each other out. We value fairness and do not allow unfair treatment. Our main rules describe how we act as a community.
