Come here, to the future! We look for the balance between economy and rights. Life is short so you should be allowed to do whatever you like (but if you interfere in other one&amp;#39;s rights and freedom you&amp;#39;ll be punished). We believe in change, in education. The human being isn&amp;#39;t evil so we promise methods to let everybody have another opportunity.
