A place with no freedom. 
now let me tell you a story about a cow.
this story is a native folk legend of one of our countries, Freeless Land. 

Once a farmer had a herd of cows.
But he had 20 cows when the limit of cows was 19 cows.
The government came to take a cow for the glorious leader.
The farmer said, &quot;That&#39;s my cow you can&#39;t have it. Without it, my family will die.&quot;
The secret police reminded him there was no property in Freeless land and that it was always the nation&#39;s cow. Everybody laughed and they shot the farmer and his family.
They&#39;re dead now.
