Democratic Republican Sub-continent is a region with nations having Democratic Republican governments. We believe in Democracy and Republicanism. Socially we favour moderately Conservative policies. Economically we are in favour of Self-employment and Free-trade (and also agriculture based economy). We are Anti-Communist, Anti-Fascist (and also against Monarchy and Anarchy).
