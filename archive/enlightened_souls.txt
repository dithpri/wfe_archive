The world is filled with false believes, constituting the walls of the Maze of Darkness. Heathens and heretics are the chains that trap the human soul inside the maze.
The few Enlightened Souls who can see through the darkness and recognize its very substance will bring light to the world.
In a promethean act of wisdom, strength and will we break the chains and tear down the walls that prevent humanity&amp;#39;s transcendence.
