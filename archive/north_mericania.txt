North Mericania was discovered in 1492 by Chrishtoffa Curungbu. The native population, Injuns, were so named because Curungbu mistakely believed he had landed in Inja. The region was later settled by various countries which formed colonies. These colonies latter became independent and naw make up the nations in the region today, including Mericania (1776), Canadicania (1867), and Mejihca (1821).
