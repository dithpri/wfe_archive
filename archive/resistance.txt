We must learn that passively to accept an unjust system is to cooperate with that system, and thereby to become a participant in its evil.
&amp;#8213; Martin Luther King Jr. 

First they came for the Communists
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a Communist
Then they came for the Socialists
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a Socialist
Then they came for the trade unionists
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a trade unionist
Then they came for the Jews
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a Jew
Then they came for me
And there was no one left
To speak out for me
