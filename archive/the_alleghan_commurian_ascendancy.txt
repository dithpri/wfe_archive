We are a democratic region seeking to establish and stabilize ourselves. We have a president and various other elected positions, along with founder restrictions and a congress to make power balanced and very interactive politics.

We welcome new members but all puppets must be declared at all times. You may be requested to prove non-puppet status for we have had many issues in thebpast with puppets in our roleplays and such.
Please read our constitution and be respectful.
