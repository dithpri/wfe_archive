[u][i][b]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/b][/i][/u]

This evil region was once a holding of the arguably just as evil [region]Confederation of Corrupt Dictators[/region], until the occupation force they had stationed here CTEd, then the hordes of invaders and defenders swarmed in to battle it out. I waited patiently, as usual, for the dust to settle, then I refounded the region to secure it. It&#39;s the same story every time, folks: The good guys win and the bad guys lose.
