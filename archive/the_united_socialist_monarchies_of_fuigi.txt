   Today, Wednesday June 24th, The Dictatorship of KakaCrossing, proud founder of The United Socialist Monarchies of Fuigi, has risen out of it&amp;#39;s depression. It has risen to help this founder-less region grow as it should have done long ago. So, as unofficial WA Delegate, I declare today, June 24th, to be Regional Rebirth Day.     
            
Hallelujah
