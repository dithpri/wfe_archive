REFOUNDED, undergoing RECONSTRUCTION.

Yeah, there ain&amp;#39;t gonna be no &amp;quot;Confederate States of the World,&amp;quot; thanks to the [b][nation=short]Union Blockade[/nation]![/b][hr]

[i]Then up with the banner so glorious
The star-spangled red, white and blue
We&amp;#39;ll fight &amp;#39;til our banner&amp;#39;s victorious
For Lincoln and liberty, too

Our David&amp;#39;s good sling is unerring
The Slavocrat&amp;#39;s giant he slew
Then shout for the freedom preferring
For Lincoln and liberty, too

We&amp;#39;ll go for the son of Kentucky
The hero of Hoosierdom through
The pride of the Suckers, so lucky
For Lincoln and liberty, too[/i]
