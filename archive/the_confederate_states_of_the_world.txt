We shall change! No rascism, but not fifty rules. We don&#146;t want people to take 5 hours to just roleplay! We are going to have rules but we don&#146;t support strict super rules! Create parties, discuss differences,politics, and have fun!

Btw I&#146;m a former member of the FREE nations reigon, I hope you join my cause to lessen the rules of most other reigons.

One rule: have fun.
