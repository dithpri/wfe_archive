A new world, set in a future close to the 2100s, on a planet called New Avalonia. Because of it&#39;s proximity to several spacial anomalies, such as a white hole, a white hole, and a neutron star. The remnants of the inhabiting civilizations clash with invaders and travelers through space-time and realities, some lusting for conquest, and others merely trying to survive.

This is a sci-fi region. Any type of government is allowed, any kinds of tech are allowed, any kinds of species are allowed, as long as they are balanced. We don&#39;t use NS stats because we don&#39;t want to bash on newbies or ruin anyone&#39;s experience.

As we are new, we currently need: a map-maker, admin, and new members in general!
