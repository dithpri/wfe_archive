A new world, set in a future close to the 2080s, on a planet called New Avalonia. Because of it&#39;s proximity to several spacial anomalies, such as a white hole, a white hole, and a neutron star. 
This is a sci-fi region. Any type of government is allowed, any kinds of tech are allowed, any kinds of species are allowed, as long as they are balanced. We don&#39;t use NS stats because we don&#39;t want to bash on newbies or ruin anyone&#39;s experience.

As we are new-ish, we currently need: new members in general!
Rule:
Whenever someone wants to update their traits of weaknesses, they need to post a link in the RMB, and list specifically what has been updated!
