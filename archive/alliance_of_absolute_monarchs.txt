In this alliance, we believe in the Status Quo of the nobility, and the Divine Right of the appointed monarch of God.  As Louis XIV, the King of France said, &amp;quot;L&amp;#39;Etat c&amp;#39;est Moi&amp;quot;, or I am the state.  In our alliance, this is of great importance.  However, because of ideology, only Absolute Monarchs may join us.  They include: Emperors, Kings, Grand Dukes, Dukes, Princes, and Sultans of an ABSOLUTE monarchist state, so please, no constitutional monarchs.

Leopold I, &amp;quot;L&amp;#39;Etat c&amp;#39;est Moi!&amp;quot;
