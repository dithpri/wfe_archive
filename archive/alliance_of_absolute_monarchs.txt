[b][color=darkblue]Welcome to the [/color][color=red]Alliance of Absolute Monarchs[/color][color=darkblue]. We are a region committed to the institution of [/color][color=red]monarchy[/color][color=darkblue], and to spreading [/color][color=red]faith[/color][color=darkblue] and [/color][color=red]tradition[/color][color=darkblue] throughout NationStates. The Autocephalous Morrainean Catholic Church is the established religion of the [/color][color=red]Alliance of Absolute Monarchs.[/color][/b]

[b][color=darkblue]We are not affiliated with a group just because we have an open embassy with them. Embassies serve as networking opportunities for us, nothing more. If there is not a documented alliance with a region, we are not allies.[/color][/b]
