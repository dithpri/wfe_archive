[i]&amp;quot;Man will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest.&amp;quot;[/i]- Denis Diderot

[color=red][b]This monarchist region has been invaded for its reactionary tags and fascist connections (embassy with [region]The Greater German Reich[/region]) during Operation Tsar Bomba by [region]The Democratic Socialist Union[/region] and [region]The Communist Region[/region]. Your founderless status made you vulnerable and your regressive nature made you an excellent target. Next time choose wisely who you establish embassies with and especially when you receive an offer from the Nutzis, remember the day you were raided by the Evil Reds.[/color][/b]

P.S. Displaying the Anti-Communist tag in a world haunted by the Red Scare of the DSU and TCR was not a good idea either.
