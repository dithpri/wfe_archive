In this alliance, we believe in the Status Quo of the nobility, and the Divine Right of the appointed monarch of God.  As Louis XIV, the King of France said, &amp;quot;L&amp;#39;Etat c&amp;#39;est Moi&amp;quot;, or I am the State.  And because of our ideology, only Absolute Monarchs may join us.  They include: Emperors, Kings, Grand Dukes, Dukes, Princes, and Sultans of an ABSOLUTE monarchist state, so please, no constitutional monarchs.
This Alliance is Ruled by the King and His three Chancellors:
King: Leopold I of the Kingdom of Belique 5 votes
State Chancellor: Franz Joseph I of Hess-Castle 3 votes, 4 in policy
War Chancellor: vacant 2 votes, 3 in military

The Absolute King of Belique
Leopold I, Duc de Roussillion
