Helm&amp;#39;s Deep is a large valley in the north-western Ered Nimrais (White Mountains).  The valley is described as being blocked over its entire width by the natural series of hills called Helm&amp;#39;s Dike and behind that lay the fortress of Aglarond or the Hornburg, at the entrance to the Glittering Caves.
