Hello, I am the Emperor of the Holy Empire of Knights and I have come to invite you to share our recent region.

You, monarch, duke, count, baron and noble lord, are you looking for a region &#151; newly created and developing &#151; to settle? The Holy Knight Empire is the ideal place.

Obs: Such a region accepts only monarchical governments and fiefdoms. There is no room for republics. So, if you are a monarch, come and dine with me, Izaaq Salazar, the Emperor of Nanderland.
