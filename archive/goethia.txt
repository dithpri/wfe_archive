The world of Goethia is an ancient land, much older than ours, with very similar people. However they themselves hold a vastly different history from us. Their technology has seemed to cease advancing around what to us would be 900AD. Their world also in way resembles ours as of that time, housing civilizations that appear to roman, anglo saxon, greek, North African, and even oriental. Despite the hardships of living in such a barbaric time, the people have made the most of it.
