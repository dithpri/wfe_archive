I have attempted to dabble in the politics of greater regions that have been around for often years and have found that they do not fit my Nations belief in war. A new region bearing the name of Neptune&#39;s great weapon that holds symbolism in the impending might and power of Nations united under war is very much necessary. Trident, with time, will be the most influential and powerful region in Nation States.
