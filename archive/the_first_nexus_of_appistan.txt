[color=gray]Welcome to the [b]The first Nexus of Appistan[/b].
Our current delegate has not been elected yet, but this region will (no matter what) be governed by a higher region, [b]Apple Island[/b]. This is a safehaven after the cease to existence of the former outpost Pear Island.

This region DOES include puppets, and at least 1 WA member to 1 puppet owned by that WA nation is required to enter this region. It is founded by [b]120A3P430TN[/b], and it is not mandatory to have more than one puppet nation. When merged by any executive of [b]Apple Island[/b], the merged nation is recommended to stay.

The WA delegate position will stay non-executive unless Thoreus says so.
