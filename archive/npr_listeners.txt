We are the only NationStates region run by and for those who listen to National Public Radio. We encourage nations, active or puppets, dictatorships or anarchy, to join us in our listening journey.

Feel free to interact with other nations in the Regional Message Board for things like posting your favorite NPR stories. We will be holding elections and adding a regional government very soon.
