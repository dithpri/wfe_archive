[color=#32a852]Welcome to the [b]Oregon Country![/b] This is a simple region, come here, kick back, and relax!

As you can see, our region is themed after the beautiful state of Oregon! Oregon is filled with trees, and naturally its largest business is the forestry industry. And fun fact, &quot;Oregon Country&quot; was coined by the British before the &#39;Seven Years War&#39; to describe the joint-occupation region between them and the French. Seeing as this region is about Oregon, our regional flag has the brown beaver on it, the pride of our region![/color]
