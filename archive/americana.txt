[b]Huzzah! The appetite of the Imperial Army continues to grow by the day, this region easily falling to the combined might of [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region] and [region]Ceseris[/region]! Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Robin was busy dreaming and missed the fun, he did not see us kick some defender butt trying to hopelessly challenge Imperialist power!

Participating Troops:

Imperial Army
General Josh Sebastian
Lieutenant-General Cephal Talleyrand
Major-General Valfor Talleyrand-Vulika
