The [b]Union of Multiversal States[/b] is a political, diplomatic, economic, military, and cultural alliance comprised of nations who share a common history and ancestry from the FB-1 Universe  and MS-1 before it, both of which have long since collapsed. These Refugee remnants have rebuilt powerful societies and have now chosen to bond together in common cause. We are the UMS.

The UMS was founded in 407 ABT (After the Battle of Tale) in the Nalydian Capital of High Tnem-Fragg.
