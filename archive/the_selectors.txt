We imprison leaders of polluting companies. We imprison all but the smart and the strong in nations that refuse to embrace the genetic manipulation technology. The imprisoned people are submited to a intensive non-paid work, they have their basic needs assured, if 2 or more members of a family are imprisoned, they are allowed to live together. They can be released if they are found to be resistant to any disease that may appear. The imprisoned must donate blood.
This region brings prodigy children born in nations that dont prioritise education to this region, where they are adopted.
