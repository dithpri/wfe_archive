The [b]Hidden Realms[/b] is an area located deep inside the subspace, where (through natural quantum-tensor-effects) two otherwise completely isolated extra-dimensional civilizations are able to get access to the Universe, more accuratly, to it&#39;s space-time reality. Therefor the two civilizations are among the best protected species existing.

There are some very limited contacts to the &#39;[region]SICON[/region]-Alliance&#39; and &#39;[nation=short+noflag]Peth Kethona[/nation]&#39;.
