The Federation of Civil Progressive Nations, or FCPN, consists of countries who value human rights and religious tolerance above all else. FCPN is comprised of mostly democratic, capitalist nations but is not a stranger to the occasional benevolent dictatorship or monarchy. As FCPN is a primarily Christian region, it uses many of the morals and values held dear by Christians to make its decisions. It is not known for its military aggression but is more than capable of uniting its various nations together at a moments notice in mutual defense. The primary common goal of FCPN is to provide an atmosphere that promotes extensive human rights and religious freedom, even at the cost of resources and power.
