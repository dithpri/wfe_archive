&amp;#9763; [b]Prince Stephen Gahan rules here, everyone in Mandelot serves him.[/b]

[Color=red][b]Now there is no tomorrow
Listen to the seven days Atlas the seven sins
The sun never comes up
The sky as black as your once white soul
And we&#39;re missing the whole...
You let us knock the Earth from your shoulders
Look what we did now
You better catch us, little man
Look in your filing cabinet for the folders
Before one of us catch you again
The snow is the ash of the volcano we blew up[/b][/color]
