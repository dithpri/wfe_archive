Welcome to [b]Cambria![/b] Me ([nation]Bahan Wortemburg[/nation]) and [nation]United cambrian borders[/nation] will have you as a member of Cambria, or become a demonic dictatorship and destroy all of Cambria&amp;#128579;. [nation]Oujodere[/nation] and us will have exiting polls to keep you entertained or you can become a role player like [nation]United cambrian borders[/nation] and look at this region with a more non-diplomatic vibe. Either way we will treat you with respect and honor ( ok maybe not honor). Here are the rules: bad words (e.g. damn) will 1st time result in a warning and second time result in a ban. Advertising other regions will 1st time result in a warning and second time result in a ban. USE COMMEN SENCE, don&#146;t say bad things about the admin of Cambria because that will result in an immediate ban.
