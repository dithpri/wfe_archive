[i][color=663333]South Africa&#146;s administrative centre is a handsome city, with a number of gracious old houses in the city centre, large, leafy suburbs, and wide streets that are lined with a purple haze of jacarandas in October and November.

It&#146;s more of an Afrikaner city than Jo&#146;burg, and its bars and restaurants are less cosmopolitan &#150; sedate Pretoria was once at the heart of the apartheid regime and its very name a symbol of oppression. Today it&#146;s home to a growing number of black civil servants and foreign embassy workers, who are infusing the city with a new sense of multiculturalism.[/i][/color]
