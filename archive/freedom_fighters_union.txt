  The FFU (Freedom Fighters Union) prides itself in just that-freedom. We do not judge, we do not care which government you belong to. We pride ourselves in acceptance and strive to help each other become better. We believe in political and civil liberties and that everyone is equal and free to be whatever and whomever they do chose to be. Anyone is welcome to join. Diversity is something to be celebrated not denied. If you want to role play, go ahead! Our goal is to liberate the oppressed and have a government where everyone&#39;s voice will be heard without fear of ridicule. We accept everyone who wishes to be kind and considerate and not judging of another&#39;s political beliefs. Long live the Freedom Fighters Union!
