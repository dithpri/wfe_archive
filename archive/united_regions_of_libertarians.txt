The United Regions of Libertarians is your representative in the politics of Nation States. It is the only political organization which respects you as a unique and responsible individual.

Libertarians strongly oppose any government interference into their personal, family, and business decisions. Essentially, we believe all Libertarians should be free to live their lives and pursue their interests as they see fit as long as they do no harm to another.
