in Gateway drug we appreciated mans rights and freedoms but got rid of them because mans true nature is to be ruled. we let the last man on the totem pole become the top man through choice. although everyone is equal, rich people have it easier because their parents worked harder. so remember, panem forever and yolo. GATEWAY DRUG for life.
