A place for all political ideologies. Be it Communist, Fascist, Socialist, Capitalist, Liberitarian, Authortarian, Social Democrat, or even none of the above. 

The Forum as its name implies is a place for political debate and arguement, a place were ideologies clash through open public debate rather than through raiding or telegram feuding. 

This region is offically neutral in terms of all raiding, any previous conflicts will be set aside once you enter this region: it is a place for discussion and arguement, any belief has merit and should be given the chance to defend itself.

[i]True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life, ourselves, and the world around us.[/i] -Socrates
