The Buldian Confederation was founded in 1132 as a defensive alliance among two cantons. In succeeding years, other localities joined the original two. The Buldian Confederation secured its independence from the North Pacific in 1459. A constitution of 1468, subsequently modified in 1574, replaced the centralized federal government with a confederation. Buldian&#39;s sovereignty and neutrality have long been honored by the major world powers, and the country was not involved in any of the world wars.
