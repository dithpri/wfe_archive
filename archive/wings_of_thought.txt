[color=red]Time doesn&amp;#39;t stop, neither can we while there a breath of life in us. I&amp;#39;ve resolved my differences with william empire for the better good as it seems Swag has put a conspiracy in progress. We have a mutual enemy, we have motive to merge for the better good as such William and I decided we shall be moving to crimson dawn.

This has been a side project for a long time but the time has come to put things in full affect. New set up, government style, balanced policies, and interesting things to do!

EVERYONE MOVE TO, [region]Crimson Dawn[/region][/color]
