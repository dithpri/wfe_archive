Kolk is a vast world of eight continents and eight oceans, each teeming with nations, cultures, and history. The people of Kolk share one faith&#151;Christianity&#151;which has shaped their laws, art, and sense of morality for millennia. Every city bears its mark through grand cathedrals, holy relics, and sacred festivals. Though united in belief, the continents often clash over power, trade, and pride. The oceans both connect and divide them, their depths rumored to hold ancient secrets. Scholars speak of Kolk&#146;s perfect balance&#151;eight lands, eight seas, one faith&#151;as proof of divine intent. Others wonder if that symmetry hides something far older than their God.
