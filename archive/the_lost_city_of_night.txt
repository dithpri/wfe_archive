In a vast sea of regions, almost none stand apart. From far away galaxies to dragon inhabited mountains and beyond, the options are vast and many.

All alone, separated from the rest, is a place known as the Lost City of Night. Here mythical creatures abound the mostly uninhabited plains, and new nations are welcome with open arms.

Wizard? Come on in. Jedi Master? No problem! Dragon slayer? Well, we quite like dragons here, but that&#39;s fine.

Here we live in peace, accepting that everyone is unique and different.
