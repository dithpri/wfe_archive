Welcome to The Deliberately Inactive Realms!

We were going to write a constitution, but then we took a nap.

Here in the Deliberately Inactive Realms, we pride ourselves on doing absolutely nothing with shocking consistency. No coups. No WA votes. No grand geopolitical strategy. Just a tranquil void of inaction. WA resolutions? Eh, we vote sometimes &#151; usually at random, if we remember.

We don&#39;t have a government. We barely have a flag. Our motto? &quot;Maybe tomorrow.&quot;

So if you&#146;re tired of puppet armies, world domination, and regions where people actually talk to each other, you&#39;ve found your blissfully uneventful forever home. Please leave your ambition at the door.
