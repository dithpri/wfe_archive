Welcome to the Confederation of Free Republics!

We are a Confederation (go figure) of Free Republics, newly founded on Valentine&amp;#39;s Day 2015. While we accept most ideologies, remember that we are a Confederation of Free Republics, so the WA Delegate or the Founder will do a random check on the WA Categories. Our official ideology is left-leaning friendly, so if you&amp;#39;re conservative, then this might not be for you.

While the CFR currently has no departments, it will as the region evolves.
