The world has never really changed, it&amp;#39;s just chosen different subjects to fight over. The world doesn&amp;#39;t attempt to re-balance itself, it constantly attempts to skew society towards a single direction. Wars aren&amp;#39;t fought for both sides to be equal, they are fought so that one side can have its way. Chaos is the nature of human beings; it is only natural that our world reflect our nature.
