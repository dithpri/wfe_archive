[region]Aegir[/region], stylized as &AElig;gir, is a Terran country that encompasses the vast, uncharted ocean from the southern coastlines of [region]Iberia[/region], and it is the homeland of the Aegir race.
A super-advanced technocracy, Aegir adopts unique political and social structures that are completely alien to the land-dwellers. Rather than having a unified head of state, each Aegirian city is ruled by a consul and their technocratic officers who assign their social roles to their citizens.

Aegir has always been a highly advanced society for millennia owing to their inheritance of the lost technologies from the &quot;Predecessors&quot;.
