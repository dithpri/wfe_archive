[region]The Black Hawks[/region] and their friends from [region]Sparkalia[/region] decided to host a party to train a new corporal after his promotion and to have some fun! Unfortunately, Hawks aren&#39;t very good at cleaning up and left a mess behind in your region. Hope you don&#146;t mind . . .
