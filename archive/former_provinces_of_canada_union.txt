If your nation is a province in Canada, then I suggest you come here 
to be a member of the FPCU. The Union is based off of a future story we invented where in the 2020&amp;#39;s to 40&amp;#39;s provinces in Canada followed Quebec in secession movements, then destroying Canada. 

Don&amp;#39;t think were a stupid region. Just want to make a fun, and interesting
region for all of you. Even if you don&amp;#39;t want to come over, just keep in
touch with us Ontarian People.
