The International Unity Project (or simply IUP) is an international organization established in 2016 for the purpose of securing world peace and global unification. It replaced its predecessor, The Coalition of Allied Nations, which had failed to bring member nations closer together or grow to adopting new nations. The IUP was founded by the two 2 largest and most devout members of the Coalition of Allied Nations.

As an organization of governments designed to grow and spread influence to nations striving for unity, The International Unity Project remains an open community and tries to reach out to the youngest nations in order to help them grow and prosper, as well as find their place in the world.
