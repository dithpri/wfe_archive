The New East Alliance is a regional organisation and intergovernmental military alliance consisting of 19 permanent members. The Alliance provides inter-regional defence aid by providing affected regions with expeditionary nations to help them fight against their aggressor. The New East Alliance was formally created under the Eastern Alliance Treaty which enables the alliance to gather collective military strength to resolve conflicts among other international organisations and regions.
