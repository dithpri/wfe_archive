No one is the same, and in the Region of Middle Normal we understand the struggle of trying to follow egotistical stereotypes that cater to more &#147;appealing&#148; opinions. The truth is that the truth hurts. So let&#146;s through cautious claims and careful statements to the wind and focus on world domination and the defending and strengthening of our own countries! Here at Middle Normal we believe that strength is not in numbers, but rather in the strategy used to gain power.
We look forward to your arrival.
