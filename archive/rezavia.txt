[Hr][hr][color=indigo][b]This region had an Embassy with the&nbsp;[region]Raxulan Empire[/region]&nbsp;but ceased to exist.

Normally we would&#39;nt refound a region that we had embassies with, but in light of the threat posed by Wintercrest, Praeson, and others, and their apparent willingness to seize regions simply because they had embassies with us, we have taken it apon ourselves to secure this region from their aggression.

If the orginal owner is interested in reclaiming their region, contact&nbsp;[nation]Rost Dreadnorramus[/nation].[/b][/color][hr][hr]
