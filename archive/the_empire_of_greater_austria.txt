[url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatches/category=1/nationid=1638760][u]What do we have here?[/u][/url] The now defunct [region]FEMDOM Nation[/region]&#39;s holding list still has some unplundered goodies! Guess I&#39;ll help myself to it! Furthermore, this region also used to be a holding of [region]The Order of the Gray Wardens[/region], and before that a colony of state enemy [region]KAISERREICH[/region], so that&#39;s just icing on the cake. I&#39;ll be taking this [i]stuff[/i] now, this one will be a personal holding.
