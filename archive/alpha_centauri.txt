Welcome lost starliner! It appears as you have just found your way into the Alpha Centauri galaxy, but we have grave news. The Centauri A star is about to go supernova, but we believe it has been sabotaged by someone called the Drove. Your job as a resident is to help us track them down, and stop them, so humanity can proceed to start their new life on Aaru-5.  They are presumably located in a universe over, which has caused some problems... But as of right now, you can relax and watch Centauri A go nova, as you will be cruising away as it explodes.

This is based on the book series, The Chronicle Of The Dark Star, by Kevin Emerson. If you can, read it! It is truly a work of art.
