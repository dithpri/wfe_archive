Alpha Centauri is a binary star system located 4.3 light-years from Earth. The people who inhabit its planets and moons are widely varried in their views and backgrounds, but all manage to get along fairly well most of the time, with the exception of a psychopathic dictator or two. Space Warriors, Crazy Communists, Bottle Washers, and Libertarian Drug Dealers all call this fair (and only slightly intoxicated) region home.
