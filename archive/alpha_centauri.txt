Alpha Centauri is a triple star system approximately 4.35 light-years from Earth. The people who inhabit Alpha Centauri&amp;#39;s planets and moons are widely varied in their views and backgrounds, but all manage to get along fairly well most of the time, with the exception of a psychopathic dictator or two. Violent Dictators, Bottle Washers, and Libertarian Drug Dealers all call this fair (and only slightly intoxicated) region home.
