The name Benelux is formed from joining the first two or three letters of each country&#39;s name &#150; Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg &#150; and was first used to name the customs agreement that initiated the union (signed in 1944). It is now used more generally to refer to the geographic, economic and cultural grouping of the three founding countries and other member states.
