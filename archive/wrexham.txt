Wrexham... a Welsh but dreadful team in the National League 5th Tier about to be taken over by non other than DEAD FRIGGIN POOL!

So hopefully we won&#39;t be such a dreadful team anymore. 

Currently cannot score a goal, which has been the case for the last 4 seasons. If only we had a decent manager.
