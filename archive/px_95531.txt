     This Region is a 5,923,154,852 square kilometer area located on the planet PX-95531 &amp;quot;Phyrus&amp;quot;. It was originally a colony of the Earth Intrasystem Colonization Corps (E.I.C.C.), but won its independence from Earth on June 28, 2231 G.Cs. (Galactic Chronostandard). It is the most powerful Independent Star System settled by Humanity and currently is in trade relations with Earth via the Twenty-Nation Trade Accords settled in 2232. The Vi Sartu Empire reigns sovereign over PX-95531; however with internal unrest stirring in the political chambers of the Empire it is only a matter of time before another bloody Phyran Civil War, like the one fought to gain the &amp;quot;Independent Star System&amp;quot; status, breaks out and the time of reckoning is upon them.
