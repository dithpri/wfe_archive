Reventy has lost its WA Delegate Endorsement. Rights to alter our regions factbook have also been revoked. The Founding Nation of Nanagram hopes these sanctions will be enough to cause Reventy to formally seek forgiveness and alter its ways. If Reventy fails to do so, or continues on its current path, further action will be taken. Nanagram considers no options to be off the table.

From the Office of,
Sir Edgar Gluethin McIII
Regional Ambassador for the People&amp;#39;s Republic of Nanagram Ministry of Foreign Affairs
