http://www.nationstates.net/region=invictus_populus_renaissance&amp;lt;-------- New Region. This one is dead. Password is &quot;LemonDemon&quot; (I accidentally set the wrong password to the other one.)
In this region, founder executive authority is OFF so people can elect someone to have executive authority. It doesn&#39;t even need to be me.

It&#39;s a bad idea to remain here since GBU has founder executive authority ON making him permanent in assigning and modifying officers.
The faster you guys join, the faster someone can be elected to rule.
