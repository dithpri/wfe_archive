[b]The Runospherian Technocratic Society[/b], RTS, or Runospheria, for short, aims for a balanced region where nations can live in harmony with each other without fear from outside influence. We tend to be quite isolationist. Runospheria currently has no allies or enemies, and we really would like to keep it that way.

Each nation in Runospheria is free to govern their lands as they see fit. However, the region as a whole, practices a Council Democracy form of government when it comes to Regional Affairs. 

[nation]Mokoraxia[/nation] is our Regional Founder.

All member states, upon joining, are required to change their currency to the dahsa. This is to centralize trade and business all over the region (and lessen any confusion among the populace, of course.)
