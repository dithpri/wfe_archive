Albarkhand is a continent constituting mostly Indo-European peoples, with people descended from Western and Eastern Europeans, and from nomadic hordes of the Steppes and Caucasus. Having previously experienced colonial interference from the British and the French, Albarkhand is a curious case, with a broad blend of cultures. The main spoken language in Albarkhand is English, followed by French, although many indigenous languages persist in the Albarkhandian Steppes and in more rural areas of some Albarkhandian nations.
