We are a moderate group supporting the ideas of free trade and diplomacy world-wide. We support democracy and hope to gain influence through economics and politics rather than blood and iron. We pride ourselves on our use of democracy to better our citizens in every possible way, and we work tirelessly for a better world for all.
