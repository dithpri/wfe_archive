The end goal is always money - and that&#146;s what we&#146;re good at. We support freedom and individual independence and liberty. We adore private corporations for the good they do to our Nations. Our Nations are patriotic, support their roots and are logical. A Nation&#39;s finance is what makes it most powerful, not the emotions of its citizens.

Not doing so will result in a permanent ban and your vote/opinion being invalid (as in not counted). The only way to undo this is to change your username to the nation&#39;s name in a shorter span of time then the election period.[/b]
