Welcome to Pie Pi, the premiere NationState&#39;s hotel (please mind the smudges on the carpet as you enter). In our luxury building we have the finest accommodations for traveling ambassadors from our embassy regions. Relax in the stimulating conversation of our RMB, share your voice in the things that &quot;really matter&quot; with our weekly polls, or take in the view of our photo gallery featuring the art from around the world. 

Have art for the Gallery? Post a dispatch with the image to the RMB for review.
