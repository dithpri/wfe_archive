[b][i][color=669999]Just Hang Loose
Just hang loose
Just have fun
Sipping on a drink, lying in the sun
Don&#39;t try to fight it
It aint no use
When you&#39;re in Hawaii just hang loose

Once there was a tourist man
Who tried to dance
He tried to learn the hula
And nearly lost his pants
He didn&#39;t try to fight it
Cause there aint no use
That&#39;s when he decided
To Just Hang Loose[/i][/b][/color]
