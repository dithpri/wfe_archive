[color=999966][b]Lahaina[/b] is the largest census-designated place in West [region]Maui[/region] and the gateway to the famous Kaanapali and Kapalua beach resorts to its north. Lahaina encompasses the coast along Hawaii Route 30 through Olawalu, and to Napili-Honokowai to the north. 

Lahaina was the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii from 1820 to 1845, when the capital was moved back to Honolulu. In the 19th century, Lahaina was the center of the global whaling industry, with many sailing ships anchoring at its waterfront; today pleasure craft make their home there. Lahaina&#39;s Front Street has been ranked one of the &quot;Top Ten Greatest Streets&quot; by the American Planning Association[/color]. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
