Welcome to The United Coalition of Nation States! This is a region were member nations are united under one united government and can take part in the Regional Assembly and many other activities. This is not a nation, federation, or any other form of government that you may think of. This is more of an association or, as the name sugests, a coalition, where nations can join one another, help one another, and care for one another. Member nations may also take part in region disputes, and can also become part of the Regional Army as well. Together, we can make a better tomorrow with what we do today, and make ther world a safer and happier place to live in. Once again, welcome to The United Coalition of Nation States.
