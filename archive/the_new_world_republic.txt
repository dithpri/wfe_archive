The NWR&#39;s nations all share a common goal. What is that goal? Is a question you might ask. Well the common goal is to control the world through treaties and annexing smaller nations. The NWR was formed shortly after a devastating nuclear war that had almost made humanity extinct. The NWR is trying to take over the world so the nations in NWR can unite and rebuild the world.
