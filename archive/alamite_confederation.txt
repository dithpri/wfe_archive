The Alamite Confederation is a local coalition of nations seeking asylum and a safe haven through their community. The region dedicates itself to safety for all of its members and the protection of all members&#39; right to their ideologies. However, players reflecting particularly hateful ideologies (ie. unironic fascism) will not be tolerated.

We will send invitations to those the leading board personally knows, but any nation who somehow manages to stumble upon our humble alliance may join as well.

Our mission statement is &quot;A Voice and Shield for All&quot;, in that this region is dedicated to making its member states&#39; interests and safety in mind.
