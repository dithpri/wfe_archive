[color=#663399]The production of silk originates in China in prehistoric times, as early as in the Neolithic (Yangshao culture, 4th millennium BCE). Silk remained confined to China until the Silk Road opened at some point during the later half of the first millennium BCE. China maintained its virtual monopoly over silk production for another thousand years. Not confined to clothing, silk was also used for a number of other applications, including writing, and the color of silk worn was an important indicator of social class during the Tang Dynasty.[/color][/i]
