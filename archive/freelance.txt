Welcome to a region that welcomes all. Freelance is pride, Freelance is truth, Freelance is power.

Here we have a great interest in all things terrestrial and celestial. From the olden days of the Space Race, to the future of galactic piracy and tourism. Any good astronauts, engineers, astronomers, and astrologists can have their say, and are encouraged to share their extensive knowledge with the community.
