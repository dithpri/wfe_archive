Toriel is a newly reclaimed landmass in the Norwegian Sea, present due to heavy volcanic activity. Located west of Norway, north of the United Kingdom, and east and north of Iceland, the landmass consists of 2 large islands each approximately 300 miles wide and an archipelago that spreads from Iceland in the south west to Svalbard in the north consisting of over 400 smaller islands ranging in size from over 40 miles across to less than a mile across. The entire mini-continent is a cluster of no less than 12 semi-active volcano and a partially submerged mountain range, risen by recent plate movements.
