[b]About the CMU[/b]

The Celestial Multiverse Union is a collection of independent nation-states that span two large continents in a rather strange and volatile part of the world.  The nations that make up this region range from a coalition of freedom-loving pirates, to a queendom of plant people, and even theocratic dictatorship that prides itself on its authoritarianism, dictatorial government and its... tourism sector.

All nations of the CMU - regardless of their ideology or politics - come together to safeguard their regional interest, and all have a stake in protecting the ocean they share: The Sea of Moondust.
