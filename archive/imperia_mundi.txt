[i]RP Date: January, 1604[/i]

[b]Nations of [region]Imperia Mundi[/region]:[/b]

We&#39;re now months into the most ambitious RP concept in NationStates history. Be proud of what we&#39;ve accomplished together. From founding, to mechanics, and where we are today; few splinter regions can claim such success. We&#39;ve seen war, peace summits, trade negotiations, civil war, assassinations, and some pretty dope IC interactions. We&#39;ve lost members to inactivity over time, but that hasn&#39;t stopped us.


Reminder to keep up to date on the rules of the RP to keep disruptions to a minimum. If you have questions, or require clarification, please ask [nation]Tzulum[/nation] or [nation]Ancient Greek Kingdoms[/nation] or just make a general post on the Discord server.
