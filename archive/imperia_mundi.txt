Proud nations of [region]Imperia Mundi[/region]: the Grand RP has begun!

If, for some reason, you don&#39;t already have a territory and/or backstory worked out for your nation but still wish to join in on the excitement to come, please contact [nation]Tzulum[/nation] or [nation]Antideluvian Empyrea[/nation] respectively to get those worked out. For general inquiries about rules and other guidelines regarding the RP, please contact either [nation]Tzulum[/nation] or [nation]Ancient Greek Kingdoms[/nation].

This region has faced opposition and setbacks since it&#39;s inception and departure from Abydos, but we have managed to create a wonderful community, and an even better RP. So let&#39;s get to it!
