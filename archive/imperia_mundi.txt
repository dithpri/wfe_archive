[i]RP Date: April, 1604[/i]


The region is over 6 months old! We&#39;ve come a long way and had some very interesting turns of events in the Grand RP. We, the administrators, understand everyone has been busy with school and work lately, and this activity has seen a decline, but the region is always here when you get the time to post.

Reminder to keep up to date on the rules of the RP to keep disruptions to a minimum. If you have questions, or require clarification, please ask [nation]Tzulum[/nation] or [nation]Ancient Greek Kingdoms[/nation] or just make a general post on the Discord server.
