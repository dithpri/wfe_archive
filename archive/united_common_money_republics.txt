This union is made of nations that united themselves a long time ago to work together (or not!) to build a better future. Over time, they became Republics, Monarchies, Dictatorships, Socialist States, Democratic States, Theocracies and much more, but there is only a few nations left. These nations are now either loyal allies or sworn enemies, but they will always stay in this union to survive and to grow more and more powerful. The main goal of this organization is to get the richest possible by having good civil rights. This region is still in development, so there is many things that are not finished yet.
