Just like our very own RL Europe, but with some change. None of the countries are governed by the liberal arsehole leaders of our times. Instead, almost all the states are all-out capitalist, imperialist states; hell bent on acquiring overseas territories in Africa and Asia, and bullying their neighbors. Also, almost all the States are at war with each almost always. Most of the States are ruled by hybrid governments, except Galimencia(and others), where the elected Prime Minister has absolute power and the King is just a mere figurehead. We also have fascist regimes like Atlantia, which is under the rule of a fascist dictator. There are some Republics too, ruled by democratically elected leaders.
