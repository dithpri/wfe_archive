The [b]Necron Underspace[/b] is a confined space-time bubble - basically a tiny isolated universe located deep inside subspace. It is thus extremely inaccessible even for advanced space-faring civilizations.

For more than 60 million years the underspace - as well as vast territories in real-space - are controlled by [b][nation]the Necron-Empire[/nation][/b].
