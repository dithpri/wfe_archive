Message from Autvia
------------------------------------------
Hello, everyone. After moving from region to region, I have decided to stay in this region and run it as a Archive region. It started with the Union of Imperials, about almost one and a half years ago. Incredible to see it has come to this. I will still be active, but not daily active. I will be running this archive region from now on. I know this region was not really active, but I want this region to be my permanent home.
God bless you all, Autvia.
