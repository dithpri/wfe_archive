The Ku (not KLU) Klux Klan was founded in Pulaski, Tennessee, sometime between December 1865 and August 1866 by six former officers of the Confederate army as a fraternal social club inspired at least in part by the then largely defunct Sons of Malta. It borrowed parts of the initiation ceremony from that group, with the same purpose: &quot;ludicrous initiations, the baffling of public curiosity, and the amusement for members were the only objects of the Klan&quot;, according to Albert Stevens in 1907[

The name is probably derived from the Greek word kuklos (&amp;#954;&amp;#973;&amp;#954;&amp;#955;&amp;#959;&amp;#962;) which means circle.
