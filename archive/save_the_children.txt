Save the Children believes every child deserves a future. Around the world, we give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.

We do whatever it takes for children &#150; every day and in times of crisis &#150; transforming their lives and the future we share.

In 2017, we reached over 49 million children directly through our and our partners&#39; work. Follow this link to read our latest Save the Children Annual Review.
