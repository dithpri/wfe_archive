The Kemetic Republic of [region]Osiris[/region] was the region&#39;s first formed government, made a few months after the region was founded.

Tags are as during the last months of the Kemetic Republic, excluding unaddable tags (which are Founderless, Gargantuan, and Sinker).

The KRO was ultimately dissolved, and a later coup formed the Osiris Fraternal Order, which has been the Osiran government ever since.
