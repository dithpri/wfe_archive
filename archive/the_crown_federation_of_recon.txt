The Crown Federation of Recon is a region that brings in proud monarchs and sovereigns of empires or kingdoms. We believe in a federation of monarchy and sovereignty that come together to form a coalition of monarchist nations which would seek guidances from the Recon Empire. All monarchs serve for the King of the Recon Empire, King Lee I.

Within the federation, we believe strongly in meritocracy and hierarchy. We believe that anyone has the opportunity to lead, but those in power should also be highly respected.

This factbook will be expanded with a proper Regional Government system when the national population reaches 20.
