The Crown Federation of Recon is a role-playing region that brings in proud monarchs and sovereigns. This is a [u]federal monarchy[/u] in which all monarchs would seek guidances from the Recon Empire. All monarchs serve for the King of the Recon Empire, King Lee I.

We believe strongly in [u]meritocracy and hierarchy[/u]. We believe that anyone has the opportunity to lead, but those in power should also be highly respected.
