The Quaint Archipelago exists close to the North Pole, giving it a relatively chill year-round weather. The exact amount of islands is unknown, as some are actually the shells of long-dead titanic turtles. No tectonic plate borders are near the Archipelago, so it is not in any immediate danger of tsunami or earthquake. 

Located in the center of the Archipelago is a dormant volcano. Several caves have been found in the sides of the volcano, and do not appear to be natural. Cave drawings have been found in many cave systems in the outermost islands, hinting at the existence of a dead civilization.
