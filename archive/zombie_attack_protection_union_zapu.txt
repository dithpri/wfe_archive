[b]Founded in 2016, we were originally a temporary zombie cure region from 10000 Islands who would later move back, but then 5 of the 7 members decided to become permanent. Who knows where the future will take us?[/b]

A warm welcome to ZAPU. Over here, we aim to create an integrated and happy community that accepts all beliefs, ideologies and nations. We will give the next six new members power over specific things like appearance and polls. And don&#39;t miss our weekly newsletter.
