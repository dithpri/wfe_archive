[b][color=FF0000]SURVIVE, CURE, PROSPER - Welcome to ZAPU [/color][/b]

[b]Founded in 2016, we were originally a temporary zombie cure region from 10000 Islands who would later move back, but then 5 of the 7 members decided to become permanent. Who knows where the future will take us?[/b]

A warm welcome to ZAPU. Over here, we aim to create an integrated and happy community that accepts all beliefs, ideologies and nations.
