Vraestris is a vibrant and immersive historical roleplay region set in the early 19th century. Founded in October 2024, the region invites nations and roleplay enthusiasts to engage in a dynamic narrative as they explore the complexities of politics, society, and culture in the 1800s. As time progresses, nations will experience the unfolding of history, with each month bringing the passage of a new year.
We are currently waiting for at least 9 nations to join before starting the roleplay. If you want to join, please telegram me for the password.
