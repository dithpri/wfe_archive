[color=#0f5b2a][b]A friend of a friend slips you a black business card embossed with a drink order and an address that leads to a rundown pub in downtown Ridgefield.[/b][/color]

Arriving, abandoned alleys, construction signs, and caution tape all clutter its shabby block; A few patrons are scattered around the bar, and the bartender idly polishes some glasses. As instructed by the card, you order an &quot;Old Hickory&quot; whiskey on ice. Two ID checks later -- you are ushered into the back; down a surgically white marble hall -- to a pentagonal conference room, with an array of displays stationed around.
