Welcome to The Western Region. Where the rules are mostly limited to the Nationstate site rules. We don&#39;t care who you are, you&#39;re welcome here. 

However we do have a Code Of Conduct that you can find here

Unsaddle your horse and settle down. Maybe get a drink at the saloon. You may finally rest here.
