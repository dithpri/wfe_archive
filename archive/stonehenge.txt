[b][color=green]What is man without other animals? If all the beasts were gone, man would die from a great loneliness of spirit. 
For whatever happens to the beasts soon happens to man - all things are connected. 
Teach your children what we have taught our children: That the earth is our mother. 
Whatever befalls the earth befalls the sons and daughters of the earth. 
Man did not weave the web of life - he is merely a strand of it. 
Whatever he does to the web he does to himself.[/b]

with love, laughter, harmony, music, freedom, sunrises and sunsets.[/color][/i]
