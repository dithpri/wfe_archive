Ghiisa has a strong belief in being able to accurately defend your decision-making for your nation and take the responsibility of caring for a nation very seriously. To gain access, you must request an application from The Founder via Telegram. Once you receive the application you are expected to fill it out to its entirety. If you leave something off of the application you will be asked to fill it in. If you lie on the application, you will no longer be considered as an applicant. Once your application has been reviewed we will notify you of our decision within 48 hours. If you are accepted you will receive a Telegram containing the password. After 24 hours, the password will be changed and you will have to request a new application.
