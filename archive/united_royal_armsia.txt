The Royal Arms headed by the snake rainofpain125 has been defeated in Nationstates just like they were defeated in Unturned, by the imperial commandos of the Asahi Squadron.  When faced with war, rain cowered like a chicken and refused to fight with his own men, ironic considering he calls for leaders to fight with their own men.  The Asahi Squadron may rest for now, but we shall mobilize again if rain tries to regain what little power he had within the Unturned community.  Let this serve as a reminder that the Asahi Squadron does not forget their enemies and will never surrender to any enemy, especially to the Royal Arms and its supporters.  Gone goes the tyrant of rainofpain125.  Tenn&amp;#333; heika banzai!
