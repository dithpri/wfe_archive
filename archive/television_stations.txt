[region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to celebrate the [color=green]14th of May[/color] in your region!

[color=yellow]14th of May is a very special day for a certain character[/color]. We danced around the subconscious of your region, opened some eyes, and tried on some hats. 

We twirled, danced, and while nyaing at everything that moved! 
The cake was brought out to appease everyone, and drinks were broken out!

[color=green]Happy day to Komeiji Koishi from Touhou![/color]
(5 14 is written almost similarly to Koishi in JPN)
