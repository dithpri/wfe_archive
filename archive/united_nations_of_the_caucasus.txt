Not just another region.

This region is here for any nations which are caucasus-like, like to be affiliated with countries that are caucasian and for any nations who just like the look of a peaceful region, that they can join without conforming to- or actively participating in regional politics. 

Political/economical/military tensions are not to be discussed or cared about here;
This region does not take a position in any conflicts in the real world, in particular in the caucasian area. Politically, the only thing we have to say about the real world, is that freedom and war are both temporary answers, and oppression never is.
