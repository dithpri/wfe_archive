This region is for Intruder&#39;s benefit. While it is possible for a new region&#39;s founder to be banjected... The founder can simply unban him/herself, like so... Dismiss the security officer, like so... Move back in, like so... And then banject the raider puppet, like so. In fact, so long as no one else in the region has executive authority, it is flat out impossible for a region with an active founder to be taken over short of banjecting everyone, waiting for the regions to be refreshed, and then refounding the region before the next time the founder is online.
