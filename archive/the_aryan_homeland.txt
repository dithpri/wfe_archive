Let me ask you something my friend, when you look around you, are you proud of this world? Are you proud to see what its become?
No? Then you&amp;#39;d be right to say that. Look, at what this world has become. Seventy years ago we tried to reshape the world into our own image, into a world of prosperity, under one banner. But those so swift, they took it from us. This is The Fourth Reich, and we stand tall, united, and strong against our oppressors.
