The European Free Alliance (EFA) works to make the idea of a &#147;Europe of the Peoples&#148; a political and cultural reality at the  international level.

It is an umbrella organisation that gathers 47 nationalist, regionalist and autonomist parties throughout the World Assembly, representing regional and traditional minorities. It focuses its activity on the promotion of the right of self-determination of peoples, human, civil and political rights, democracy, internal enlargement, multi-level governance, devolution of powers, cultural and linguistic diversity; as well as on nationalism, regionalism, autonomy and independence. The right to self-determination is a cornerstone of the EFA&#146;s program and ideology.
