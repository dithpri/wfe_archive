Tenna (adj. Tennanit) is an Earth-like planet, having the exact same properties as the Earth barring tectonic plates, continents, certain fauna, and biomes. It&#39;s also the third planet in its solar system whose star is essentially a Sun 2.0. Humans are also the dominant species, known in Tenna as [i]dahsahin[/i].
