Welcome to the Auropean Union. 

The Auropean Union is an ever growing role playing community. 
Using the map of Europe, we role play different Political, Economical and International scenarios.

If you wish to join us, you have 2 options:
1) Pick a [color=orange]YELLOW[/color] nation on the map and ask for that account. (Yellow nations are pre-made accounts that can be given to anyone in the AU)
or 
2) Play as your current nation and choose a [color=green]GREEN[/color] country to take over. Message the founder with your country of choice, and once you are on the map, you can officially join in.
