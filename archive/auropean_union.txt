The Auropean Union is a RP community. We use the World map as our RP Ground. 
The Auropean Union takes the place of the UN in the RP.
The WA has no place in the RP and does not exist. 
The WA Delegate is the Peoples Elected Chancellor. Simply there to be a voice for the AU members. 
The Founder is the President. There to put forth Legislation and to enforce legislation.
