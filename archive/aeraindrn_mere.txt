[b]Welcome to Aeraindrn Mere: The Casual Region for the Casual Player[/b]

Welcome to Aeraindrn Mere. Do you not have a lot of time to be online? Outside obligations that keep you from fully committing to play? Do you want a place to just hang your hat and play at your leisure without worry about being attacked, asked to join a war or do anything you are not comfortable with? Then this is the region for you.

I only have one rule: Have fun, relax, and play it your way.
