Please join if you are in any way affiliated with our institution. We&amp;#39;ll party &amp;#39;Grove City&amp;#39; style: with shoes in the door, feet on the floor, and staying off the grass.

Also, invading us is futile. We have God on our side. Contact New juvex or Planet pencil tin for admissions counseling. Naming the permanent things Grovers&amp;#39; are anchored to in a sea of change will merit special consideration.

Grove City College, &amp;quot;where your best hasn&amp;#39;t been good enough since 1876.&amp;quot;
