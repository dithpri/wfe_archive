We are a region that strives for a greater tomorrow through equality, diplomacy, and friendship. We have open arms and will take in any country with open arms. We hope that all nations will join us. This region can and will most likely have some role playing in the future. There is a regional currency called the Freedom Credit, or FKC (Free Kratsville Credit). USE OF THIS CURRENCY IS NOT MANDATORY. We do ask for members to try and look at their nations every few days and to participate in polls, RPs, and region chats. We also ask for national animals and mottos to not be the same as other members (although we do understand if they are similar). We hope you have a good stay in the Union of Kratsville and we can&#39;t wait to see you here.
