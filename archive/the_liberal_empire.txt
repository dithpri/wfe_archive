The Liberal Empire was founded on ideas of liberty and equality. Liberals espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of these principles, but generally they support ideas and programmes such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, free markets, civil rights, democratic societies, secular governments, gender equality, and international cooperation. Liberalism first became a distinct political movement during the Age of Enlightenment, each man and women has a natural right to life, liberty and property, Liberals oppose traditional conservatism and we sought to replace absolutism in government with representative democracy.
