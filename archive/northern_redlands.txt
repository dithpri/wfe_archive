[color=red][b]INTRODUCTION[/b][/color]
A large landmass covered in tall forests, rolling mountains, and beaches of pure, white sand. The mighty Encabo river flows through the central Valley of Death, its swift current over the years carving a massive canyon towards the southernmost parts. Butcher lake, to the east, serves as the largest and deepest lake in the region with an area of 27,420 square miles. Mt. Mik to the northwest serves as the tallest mountain in the region.
