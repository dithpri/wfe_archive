[b]Northern Redlands[/b] is a large region covered in tall forests, rolling mountains, and pure-white sand beaches. The Encabo River, which flows through the Valley of Death, has carved a massive canyon towards the southernmost parts. To the east, Butcher Lake serves as the largest and deepest lake in the region, with an area of 27,420 square miles. Mt. Mik in the northwest serves as the tallest mountain in the region. Recently, two new continents, Perasova and Paulandia, as well as two massive polar ice caps were discovered.
