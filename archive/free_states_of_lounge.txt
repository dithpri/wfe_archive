A region where the sun never sets on personal freedom and enjoyment of life&amp;#39;s sensual pleasures without fear of reproach or guilt. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter what beat you dance to, just that you dance! Anything goes in this region as long as you respect the personal freedoms of your neighbors and their right to express themselves in their own way. Nations must be aware of their effect on those around them and never try and forcefully impose their values or beliefs on others. Nations solve their grievances through mediation over a vodka bottle and Deep House music in a specially adapted red-velvet lounge room with mood lighting. No shouting or shooting allowed! More white beach coastline than Australia.
