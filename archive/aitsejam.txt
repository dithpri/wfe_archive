Basically [region]Majestia[/region] but instead of what it is right now, Simonia (the founder of Majestia) is called Somini and has a different flag, it is a frontier, Simonia never created any puppets or joined the WA, there was no big RMB silence, it never started embassy collecting, and raids are welcome.
Yes, you heard me right. Raid this region. We won&#39;t care. This is an experiment region anyways.
New nations are more than welcome!
