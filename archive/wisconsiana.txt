The Wisconsin I once knew was a weak, socialist state... disgusting. Gilman has now risen to power to conquer all of the new district of Wisconsiana, a region consisting of Minnesota, west of the Mississippi; Illinois, a strip of land consisting of the tip of Lake Michigan to Iowa; The Upper Peninsula of Michigan; and Manitoulin Island, as well as some land from Canada that consists of land above Minnesota, but below the 49th parallel.

Glory to Gilmania!
