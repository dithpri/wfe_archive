In 1969, Three Guy&#39;s founder and CEO, Steven, began what is today his world-renowned business.

Steven&#39;s mother, Matthew, had always told him, [b]&quot;Raidas bad. Only &#39;onest money in this world is fenda money.&quot;[/b] Steven took this to heart, until he realised that his mother was actually the chief propagandist for XKI. Upon this realisation, Steven had to make a choice. Would he become a fenda like his mother always wanted him to, or would he become a raider?

In the end, the raider route won out.

Steven, with Guy 2 and 3, Nate and Will, became the founders of the new and original franchise Three Guys: Burger and Fries. Steven made it his life&#39;s mission to destroy that which had destroyed his mother: defending. And so this dream would be seen through.
