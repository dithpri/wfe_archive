We must follow the codes of chivalry 
To fear God and maintain His Church
To serve the liege lord in valor and faith
To give succor to widows and orphans
To refrain from the wanton giving of offence
To live by honor and for glory
To obey those placed in authority
To guard the honor of fellow knights
To keep faith
