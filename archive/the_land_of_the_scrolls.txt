Long ago, Our Divine Lady of the Scrolls, Zelda, inscribed the first words of creation, while Theon, Lord of the Stars, scattered them across the heavens. Their myths survived in fragments until a wanderer uncovered the ancient parchments within Zeldabor&#146;s canyons. From these scrolls, the Lands of the Scrolls were founded&#151;not as a nation of borders, but as a home for stories, wisdom, and community. Each new nation that joins becomes another page in our ever-growing epic, a living history written among the stars.

&quot;History is not written by victors&#151;it is written by the Scrolls.&quot;
