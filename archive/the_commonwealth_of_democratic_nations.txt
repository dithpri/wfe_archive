During it&amp;#39;s lifetime, [region]the Commonwealth of Democratic Nations[/region] was the direct successor to the [region]The New British Empire[/region] and a bastion of democracy, transparency, and liberty. TNBE itself, had survived multiple fascist coups and one period where it&amp;#39;s founder had ceased to exist suddenly, of which is was locked down by [region]REATO[/region]. Later, the founder returned and dissolved TNBE to create [region]the Commonwealth of Democratic Nations[/region]. However, misfortune hit the British again as their leader had gone AWOL and betrayed by it&amp;#39;s very own delegate, who gave the region to [region]The Dictators League[/region] on a platter. However, it&amp;#39;s delegate - the last person in the region - had moved without replacing himself, and the region was then secured by REATO.
