A friend of [region]Minoa[/region]. They came up with the idea of making up their own portfolio of regions and then tag them all &amp;quot;neutral&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;independent&amp;quot; and then trying to create embassies with virtually every region in the world so that there would be less loneliness.
