[b][i]Welcome to [region]Arrowstorm Field[/region], heroes![/b][/i]

This vast stretch of grassy plateaus is the protectorate of the stoic Wolf Clan hero, [nation=short]River the Howling Arrow[/nation]. Take care not to harm any innocent creature wandering these wild plains or you&#39;ll risk her wrath! River is a devoted guardian who can become fierce when she is angered and she&#39;ll make sure you never see the arrow coming.

The [nation=short]King of Armello[/nation] has taken note of this lupine lass and fearing her strength, he has placed a curse upon this once welcoming land just north of [region]Southbank[/region], causing anyone that travels this field to be struck with grave misfortune soon after. Whichever Clan should score the most points here in [region]Arrowstorm Field[/region] shall break the curse and claim the region as their own!
