This coalition is based on the Briona continent, a bustling land infested with reptiles, demons, and entities from another dimension. The coalition is dedicated to purging Briona of all of these in order to make it a more habitable, safer place to live and thrive.

The coalition is currently ruled by Uddermeniac, a cheese loving nation located at the center of the Red Gulf region of Briona. Any insubordination or breach of the coalitions contract will be immediate termination under the all powerful rule of Uddermeniac.
