Luon is a collection of nations and alternative communities who have banded together for defense, trade and free travel between countries of the region. We like to take in countries looking to develop rich lore of themselves as well as shape the lore of our region. 

Luon is never set in stone. It is fluid and always changing as it develops it&#39;s history and culture and how it runs.

There are no limitations to what your country can be. It can be a dictatorship consisting of a fleet of ships that executes people for feeding sea birds, an ant Queendom that has discovered how to gain human-like intelligence and ability or whatever you like. The more interesting and unique your country or community is, the better.
