Welcome to The Outback, a region where the sun always bakes the horizon, the wildlife is out to get you, and everything you see (or don&#39;t see) [i]will[/i] try to kill you.

Here, the emus always win the wars, and the spiders have tenancy rights. The drop bears will fall up onto you for the kill. The sun is hotter than your ex&#39;s temper, the flies are more persistent than a telemarketer, and everyone is just one head shave away from turning into Mad Max. Despite it all, the people are unfailingly friendly (if slightly suspicious of your accent), the beer is cold, the barbies eternal, and the sunsets are pretty!

Pack your sunscreen, practice your shoey, and prepare for a place where the only thing more dangerous than the wildlife is the banter.
