Welcome to the United League of Nations! This is an old region, one of the first! While it has ceased to exist many times though the years, that was due to incompetent founders and delegates. This time is different because our founder account will always remain active and because of YOU! With your help, we can make this a great home. A place to build the future and raise up the next leaders of not just this region, but NationStates as a whole.[hr]
