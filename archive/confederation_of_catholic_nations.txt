The Confoederatio Nationum Catholicarum (CNC) is an international organisation that aims to unite all nations that have a strong Roman Catholic population under one united flag loyal to the Bishop of Rome.

The Confederation seeks to uphold our beloved faith in Jesus Christ our Lord and loyalty to our Holy Father, Leo XIV, cooperatively.
