[color=navy]Considering joining our region? Well, join us, and endorse our delegate, [nation]heromerland[/nation], our Vice President, [nation]Homalia[/nation], and our Minister of Communication, [nation]Axelotl[/nation] for regional security![/color]
[hr][region]The Obsidian Highlands[/region] is the friend of ours

[color=green]Embassy kinda accepted? We have no embassy policy at the moment, but for now if we deemed you worthy and have no invader tags then it&#39;s fine[/color][/b]
