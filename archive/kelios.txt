[b]Hail![/b]

The friendly neighbours at [b][region]Lone Wolves United[/region][/b] have decided to pay your lovely burgeoning region a visit. We have a few suggestions on the matter of design &#150; and I regret to inform you that they are [i]non-negotiable.[/i] Everything shall be made darker and caniner and therefore objectively better. Anyone trying to disrupt our generous redecoration efforts will be promptly educated on proper design and then ejected.
