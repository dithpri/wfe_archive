By popular vote, our anthem is this:

Greenland &#150; our sacred state,
Greenland &#150; our beloved region.

A mighty will, a great glory &#150;

Yours forever for all time!

Chorus:
Be glorious, our free Fatherland,
Ancient union of brotherly peoples,
Ancestor-given wisdom of the people!
Be glorious, our country! We are proud of you!
From the southern seas to the polar lands

Spread are our forests and fields.

You are unique in the world, one of a kind &#150;

This native land protected by God!

Chorus
Wide expanse for dreams and for living

Are opened for us by the coming years

Our loyalty to the Fatherland gives us strength.

So it was, so it is, and so it always will be!
