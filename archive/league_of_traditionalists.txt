                             &#134; Welcome to the League of Traditionalists! &#134;

A place for nations who wish to reject degeneracy and embrace tradition and develop together. The perfect place for right-wing religious people (of Abrahamic religion &amp;#10013;&amp;#65039;&amp;#9770;&amp;#65039;&amp;#10017;&amp;#65039;) 
           
       &amp;#128683; No commies, Satanists, Progressive &#145;Christians&#146; or anti-religious allowed!&amp;#128683;

It is okay if you are slightly left-leaning, just not too far left. Also it is okay if you are atheist, just be respectful to religious people, and to religious people, also be respectful to atheists.

If you start debating with somebody, please, be as civil as possible. Try help fellow members out if they&#146;re confused, endorse others and, most importantly, don&#146;t be rude.
