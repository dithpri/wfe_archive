[b]Welcome to Rostil![/b] Originally founded in 2010 it is one of the older regions on NationStates. We are a closed-world MT RP group constantly looking for new members to help us build our world, which is based in an original solar system. We welcome prospective members to apply for membership via our application thread, and wish the best for our current, future and former members. Have fun! 

Rostil has a strong tradition of discussion between its members.
