Welcome to Rostil, an MT/Fantasy RP region based around an original planet and solar system located in the Pinwheel Galaxy. As Rostil is an RPing region we are not at all interested in raiding/defending and recruiters for other regions are unwelcome. Rostilian nations range from constitutional republics to fascist dictatorships and even completely original governments.

Rostil is a Direct Democracy, every region-mate gets a vote on regional issues.
