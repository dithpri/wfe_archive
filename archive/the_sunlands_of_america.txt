Hello, welcome to The Sunlands of America. A place where Democracy rules free. To get an office job, you will go through an election. If the position is open, you can run for it, and a special election will be held. If the position is filled, you may challenge the incumbent holder in an election. Multiple people can run at a time. Hope you enjoy your stay in the SoA!
