[i]&quot;For by the Fire of her eyes
And the rattle o&#39; Fortune&#39;s Dice
She is the Burning Witch

Heaven&#39;ly fire fell to earth
Here to grant a second birth
She is the Burning Witch

Ash and fire brought to light
Come to fight the &#39;ternal fight
She is the Burning Witch

Fear, o&#39; fear, o&#39; child of mine
Let terror tingle down your spine
She is the Burning Witch

On leath&#39;ry wings as black as night
On beast of most ferocious might
She is the Burning Witch&quot;
