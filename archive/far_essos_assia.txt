Throughout the entire history, Far Essos Assia is marred with war, famine and strife. But under the leadership of Oberstkrieggruppenfuhrer Carl Von Briand Claussenwitz, also known as the Herrlich Jaeger &quot;Glorious Hunter&quot;,  the Far Essos Assia achieves a thousand years of pacific development and expansion. The Edict of Oberosttereich ,in 1908, paved the way for the formation of a unified and galvanized opposition against the foreign expansionism and imperialism.
