The year was 1337, and Captain Heratio Martini was drinking heavily. What should&amp;#39;ve been a routine trip to Sicily, turned into a long meandering journey across the Atlantic. Landing off the coast of what is now New England, he met with the local Penobscot Indians, whom he promptly slaughtered. The land was then claimed in the name of the Auratian Empire, which did not exist. Again, he was super hammered this whole time. What happens next is unclear, but what we can discern from his personal journal had something to do with a hatchet, an acorn, and a bottle of vodka. Thus, Liete was formed!


Liete was later plundered by the British and made into a colony and renamed Leetmerica!
