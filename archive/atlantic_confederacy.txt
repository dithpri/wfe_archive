The Atlantic Confederacy formed by the islands of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia in the year 1868.

The Atlantic Confederacy has yet to be formed as currently in the role-play, Nova Scotia has not become an Independent state yet and it is the year 1764, 104 years before the Confederacy is formed.

Right now its just the nation of Newfoundland and its colonies of Cuba and Great Inagua.
