I can feel it coming, humming in the way you move
Push the reset button, we&#39;re becomin&#39; something new
Say you got somebody, I&#39;ll say I got someone too
Even if it&#39;s handcuffed, I&#39;m leavin&#39; here with you
Bygones will be bygone, eras fadin&#39; into gray (Fading into gray)
We broke all the pieces, but still wanna play the game (Oh)
Told my friends I hate you, but I love you just the same
Pick your poison, babe, I&#39;m poison either way
