[i]Sable Island&#146;s wild horses are world-famous, but there&#146;s so much more to this remote sand island off the coast of Nova Scotia. The world&#146;s largest colony of Grey seals breeds here, as do the rare Roseate Tern and the endemic Ipswich Sparrow, among many birds of note. Amid the island&#146;s 42 km of beaches, dunes and bogs you&#146;ll find a plethora of plants: from iris, to sundew, to wild berries in abundance. Whales and sharks ply the nearby waters.

Sable Island&#146;s history includes shipwrecks and salvage; sealing and walrus hunting; rescue and research.[/i]
