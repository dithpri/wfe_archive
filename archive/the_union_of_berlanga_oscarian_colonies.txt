A union of independent colonies of [nation]West Berlanga and Greater Oscari[/nation]

After an unsuccessful coup&amp;#39;d etat against the government of [nation]West Berlanga and Greater Oscari[/nation] by a coalition comprised of a liberal Jewish community and a supra-conservative protestant sect failed, these groups split into two independent nations,  [nation]the Jewish Populus of Lesser Oscari[/nation], and [nation]Berlangian Protestants[/nation], and formed this region in which they co-existed. After 40 years of a &amp;quot;cold war&amp;quot; between the region and [nation]West Berlanga and Greater Oscari[/nation], the latter finally annexed the nations of the region as independent colonies.
