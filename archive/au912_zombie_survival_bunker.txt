[b]--- REGIONAL EMERGENCY ZOMBIE PROTOCOLS ---[/b]
1) All nations are requested to attempt to develop a cure.
2) Any nation embracing the zombies for more than 3 minutes, attacking another nation with zombie hordes, or attacking another nation with military forces when not requested will be ejected and banned.  The 3 minutes are so that if you hit the wrong button accidently you can change it.
