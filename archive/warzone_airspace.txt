[b]Warzone Airspace is under the temporary administration of [region]Wintreath[/region].[/b]

It would appear that someone got the idea to kick out a bunch of residents and try to close our embassy. I hope this lesson won&amp;#39;t need repeating.

This operation was conducted by Hvitt Riddaral members Wintermoot and Chanku, as well as irregulars Nox and LibLib. Thank you all for heeding the call.
