[color=0276FD][b]The Warzone Federation, a hodgepodge Of Warzone collections that I helped to build, consisted of [region]Warzone Europe[/region], [region]Warzone Asia[/region], and [region]Warzone Airspace[/region].

This Warzone stands as a monument to the brave Legionaires of [region]the Pacific[/region], who liberated [region]Warzone Asia[/region] from fascist invaders from the CCD. I promised a Warzone embassy as a thank you, showing my gratitude to the liberators, and I have delivered on this promise.[/color]
