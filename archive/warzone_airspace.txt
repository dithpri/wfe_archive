One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. 

[i]that doesnt even make sense an elephant is way too big to fit in human sleep fur or do you mean that you were wearing human sleep fur and then you found an elephant and shot it maybe you should learn to use commas otherwise its hard to tell what youre trying to say and also if you shot it i hope there were others around that were hungry because thats a lot of meat that would go to waste[/i] ([nation]Evil Cub[/nation])
