[color=4591DE][b]Regional Notices:[/b][/color]

* Following an invasion by the most righteous, humane, and civil [b]Cataphracts of Blepia[/b], in addition to a much-appreciated volunteer, this region was conquered. We intend to restore the righteous native form of government in a jiffy, and I, [nation]Central Blepia[/nation], am in talks with several prominent Warzoners. Feel free to express discontent, complaints, concerns, and requests to the new Government.

* We apologize profusely for the erroneous ejection of [nation]Korbana[/nation] and [nation]1st Tolfaerian Army[/nation], long-standing members of this region, and invite them to return.

* You are cordially invited to join [url=https://discord.gg/dU47wBn]the Warzone Discord[/url] and the [url=https://discord.gg/yG2G9d9]Warzone Airspace Discord[/url].
