[b]Warzone Airspace is under the temporary administration of [region]Wintreath[/region][/b]!

On this day, the Hvitt Riddaral charged forth into the region, to rebuild that which had been destroyed, to conduct training exercises, and to improve our forces for future operations. Our stay in Warzone Airspace is merely temporary, as is often the case for warzones. We intend no harm to the region and hope that our stay will be a peaceful, friendly one.

To ensure the security of this operation, all WA nations [b][u]must[/u][/b] endorse [b][nation=short]Alerss[/nation][/b] [i]and[/i] be a member of the Hvitt Riddaral or a native which was in the region previously. All other WA nations will be ejected. Thank you for your cooperation!
