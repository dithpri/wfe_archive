[color=0276FD][b]The Warzone Federation, a hodgepodge Of Warzone collections that I helped to build, consisted of [region]Warzone Europe[/region], [region]Warzone Asia[/region], and [region]Warzone Airspace[/region].

[i]Controlling two of them at the same time was fun while it lasted.[/i]


This Warzone stands as a monument to the brave Legionaires of [region]the Pacific[/region], who liberated [region]Warzone Asia[/region] from fascist invaders from the CCD. I promised a Warzone embassy as a thank you, showing my gratitude to the liberators, and I had every intention of delivering on this promise, as long as it&#146;s within my power to do so. 

[u]If you want the region, then take it. Preferably without convincing someone to work against me ;)[/u]

Endorse the Delegate, [nation]Black Keep[/nation], or you&#146;ll be sent straight to [region]the Rejected Realms[/region].
