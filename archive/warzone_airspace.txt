Unfortunately, Warzone Airspace was the subject of a hostile takeover. As the selfless heroes they are, the lawyers of LazCorp&#39;s [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1453785]Paralegal Department[/url] came to the struggling department&#39;s aid. With legal advice from [region]Osiris[/region](TM), [region]the West Pacific[/region] and [nation]Evil Cub[/nation], the takeover was swiftly reversed.[hr] [b]Endorse [nation]Hollow Words[/nation] and [nation]Airspace Etoarmaaptim[/nation] or face not only our fiercest lawyers in trial (by combat), but also Evil Cub will raid you and call you a meaniebutt.[/b]

(Evil Cub will also raid you and call you a meaniebutt if you don&#39;t give him food, so give him some, preferably of the uncooked very-recently-still-running-around variety)
