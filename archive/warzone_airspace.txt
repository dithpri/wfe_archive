Imagine a world without founders or delegates. The WFE can not be edited and your posts can not be suppressed. There are no embassies or polls.  

Once you give up everything, you gain everything. No one has more institutional power over another. Everyone is equally free. True leadership will arise by your ability to convince others on their own free will. 

There is only one rule: Don&amp;#39;t try to to take the delegacy. Twelve guardians, who will only have &amp;#39;border control&amp;#39; and nothing else will eject any nations who attempt do so.
