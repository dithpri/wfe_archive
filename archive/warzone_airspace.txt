[color=#990000][b]Sayonara to our friends in the Augustin Alliance and their buddies [nation]Armaros[/nation] and [nation]Your Imaginary Friend[/nation] who previously took this region from its native delegate for the sake of an embassy. This region has now been taken by the Legio Pacifica. We will proceed to have a nice tea party. All return fire is welcome.

I will await you at update with a hopeful heart.[/b][/color]
