SECURITY RATING: DEFCON 3 (Join [region]Definitely NOT Warzone Airspace[/region] if the region has been raided to regroup and take back)

Once, only a while ago, our region was attacked by the enemy, but now we shall not fear! For Repreteop has promised to guide us through the pains and UP WITH THE TRIUMPH!

We wish to thank our saviors and friends in the Mystical Alliance and the other warzones!

We are trying to move back to normal and prosper, please keep that in mind, something might look old...
