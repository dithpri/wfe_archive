[b]Warzone Airspace is under the temporary control of the [region]Wintreath[/region] Hvitt Riddaral and the [region]Spiritus[/region] Defense Force[/b]

On this day, two forces, composed of calvary and magi, charged for into the region together, determined to restore that which had been damaged before. They swept the invaders masquerading as natives from the region, and restored the damage caused by the last assault against the region. Our forces are now merely passing through on the way to other battlefields, as is often the case in warzones. No harm to the region or its true natives is intended.
