[i]It is the Mid-21st Century. Civilisation as we know it is gone. The unrestrained greed and decadence of man ushered in [b][color=brown]The Great Devastation[/color][/b] as cities perished, nuclear winter fell and seas rose, swallowing up the lands. The remaining territories became highly prized Warzones as survivors turned against each other for scraps. Yet amidst the chaos, a small group of idealist had an ambitious plan: Reunite the world and restore man&amp;#39;s glory once again.[/i]
