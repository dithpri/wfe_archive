I&amp;#39;ve kept Airspace for some time mainly for my friends, but it&amp;#39;s clear we no longer have the time any more. It&amp;#39;s better to let other write their own stories, than for me to hold this forever for no reason. 

After 2.5 years in the Warzones, it&amp;#39;s also time for me to do something new. NS is about being fun, not a chore.  

It has been a good run. Thanks for the memories.
