[b]Warzone Airspace was previously under the temporary administration of [region]Wintreath[/region][/b]!

Some days ago, the Hvitt Riddaral charged forth into the region, to rebuild that which had been destroyed, to conduct training exercises, and to improve our forces for future operations. Our stay in Warzone Airspace was pleasant if not sleepy, as is often the case for warzones, but we leave a better force nonetheless.

[b][color=red]This mission has been successfully concluded! Hvitt Riddaral members please return to Wintreath and endorse the delegate unless you are needed for other operations.[/color][/b]
