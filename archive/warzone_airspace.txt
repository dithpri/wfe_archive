[color=goldenrod][i]The Belgian Kingdom of Warzone Airspace confirmed?

Funny Belgium day is today, Anarchy is over but perhaps we can try to run a anarchist government with a council? *wink wink*
Today the region is Belgium themed because [b]Repreteops wife is forcing our Skylord to do it or divorce![/b][/i][/color]

[color=blue]Once, only a while ago, our region was attacked by the Black Hawks, but now we shall not fear! For Repreteop has came back to save the day.

We wish to thank our saviors and friends in the Mystical Alliance and the other warzones!

Endorsement cap: 0, this will be until the government is stable, all World Assembly nations MUST endorse [nation]Repreteop[/nation], this may change once we can get stable though.
