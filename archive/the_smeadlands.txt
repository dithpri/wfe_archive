[region]The Islands of Smead[/region] was founded by [nation]The Smead Worshipers[/nation], on 10/6/2020
&amp;#10240;
&amp;#10240;
&amp;#10240;
It was a relatively small but lively region, filled with Smead Worshipers. Life on the island was like a paradise, it was one 
&amp;#10240;
of the most peaceful places on NationStates, until, it vanished. Most, if not All of the once lively citizens of the island 
&amp;#10240;
vanished, including the founder of the island leaving it a boneyard for months. Then something unbelievable happened, 
&amp;#10240;
the founder had come back, and with him came a couple citizens from the old Island, because it was in such a rough 
&amp;#10240;
shape some pilgrims from the old island decided to look for new land to settle, and that land became The Smeadlands
