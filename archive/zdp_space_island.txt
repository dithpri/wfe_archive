Welcome to the space island.
The ZDP Space Island is a space biosphere project in the zombie department. If you are interested in joining make sure to build a elite crew to reduce risk of death. There are many things you may find on the island (zombie wolfs, old crew members, time warps, volcanoes space sheep ect.) but what happens on the island stays on the island. Just remember &quot;don&#39;t die&quot;.
