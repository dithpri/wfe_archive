200 years ago the great nations of this region fought in a great war. Each of the nations discovered the great power of a nuclear bomb.The nations launched bombs against each other ignorant of the price they had to pay. The bombs devastated the land. Only 3 nations survived the great war. The nations survived underground for 100 years. When the time came for the nations to leave their massive vaults only 2 came out. United together in a strong alliance they tried to rebuild what now is a waste land. The nations failed thanks to two old grumpy men who started a civil war in one of the nations. Now a wasteland remains to conquer.
