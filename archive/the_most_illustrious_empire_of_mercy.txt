Notable for the state-planned economy, compulsory military service, and irreverence towards religion our cynical populations are kept under strict control by our most illustrious government. The large, well-organized government prioritizes Law &amp; Order, although Defense, Education, and Healthcare are also important, while Spirituality isn&#39;t funded. The economy is driven entirely by a combination of government and state-owned industry, with private enterprise being either illegal or heavily monitored. Crime, especially youth-related, is totally unknown, thanks to a very well-funded police force and progressive social policies in education and welfare.
