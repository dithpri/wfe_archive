A Card Farming region owned by [nation]Millenhaal[/nation]/[nation]Veldevande[/nation]


Only contains elements Hydrogen to Berkelium, except for one sneaky one, who I will not name. If you can find out, you get a card! I can&#39;t possibly farm more with my current resources.


Thulium is the most useless and dumb and stupid element. Deb8 me on my mains, I dare you.
