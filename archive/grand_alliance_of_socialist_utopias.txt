Formed from the ashes of history and in the wake of the Capitalist system collapsing in on itself, the Grand Alliance of Socialist Utopias had a tough beginning. Initially resorting to a tribal-communism, they eventually grew into Socialist Utopias which every worker lives until they have happily served their Commune.

The Grand Utopias vote for their leaders and happily serve whoever is chosen as the One Delegate of their Grand Alliance, which binds the Socialist world together!

Long live the Commune!
