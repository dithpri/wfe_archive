The nation of Elric, founded in 2017, decided to start a region after the Nation of Homunculus started reigning terror upon the Elrician people.

Never a people to be cowed, Homunculus forced itself into the democratic region and has fought ever since to take over Philos and turn it into a tyrannical region in which its people have no freedom.
