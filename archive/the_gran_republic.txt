Hello, and welcome to [region]The Gran Republic[/region]!

Here, we pride ourselves on the ideals of freedom and Republicanism.

Instead of having WA delegates, we vote for Consul on polls. The consul has the power to choose other officials. A Consul (Governor/Tallstar) can only have 2 terms, each being a month. If you have any questions, just ask the consul or his vice. :D
In case of an emergency, the current consul would stay as consul until the emergency is over.
When the term is over, the former governing party has to resign, and the next poll begins!
