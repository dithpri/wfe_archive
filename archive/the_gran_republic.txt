Hello, and welcome to [region]The Gran Republic[/region]!

Here, we pride ourselves on the ideals of freedom and democracy.

Instead of having WA delegates, we vote for Governor on polls. The governor has the power to choose other officials. A Consul (Governor) can only have 2 terms, each being a month. If you have any questions, just ask the governor of his vice. :D
Incase of a emergency, the current governor would stay as Governor until the emergency is over.
When the term is over, the former governing party has to resign, and the next poll begins!
