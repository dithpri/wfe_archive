Hello :D
I&#39;m a alt of [nation]The Teutonic Kingdom[/nation] and I made this region :)
Instead of having WA delegates, we vote for Governors on polls. The elected Governor can elect his vice Governor. The Governor can only rule for a month, after the month, we have another poll! Hope your day is good :D
A Consul (Governor) can only have 2 terms! (Means they can be Consul/Governor for 1 more month [b][i]IF[/i][/b] the people elect him again!)
