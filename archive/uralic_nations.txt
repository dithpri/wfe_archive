Hi, I&#146;m Vepsiland, founder of Uralic Nations. Comprising of countries with a language in the Uralic group. Weather it&#146;s a Finnic like Finnish and Karelian, or a Baltic Finnic, like Veps or Estonian, come and join! Hungarian counts to! And if this offensive, because I&#146;m Finnish myself, let me know by a telegram!
