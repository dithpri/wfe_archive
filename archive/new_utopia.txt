The region of New Utopia strives to provide their citizens with an ideal living and working environment as embodied by the term &quot;Utopia&quot;. Although the methods for doing so are as diverse as the philosophers that have pondered on the subject, all New Utopians enjoy debating the merits of their philosophies and celebrate the phoenix, the region&#39;s mascot. Like the Phoenix, New Utopia represents the rise of the former region &quot;Utopia&quot; into a new region, known as New Utopia. We intend to carry on the legacy of this region.
