&amp;quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.&amp;quot;

Thudd is a region that welcomes nations of all varying politics, and oppresses none. Nations are free to be run the way they choose without outside interference. It is a melting pot of political opinions, and no voice will be silenced.

Nations are encouraged to join the World Assembly and participate in regional politics.
