An island of four nations, attempting solemnly to live in harmony. The peaceful, beautiful nation of Novi Libertas is the largest and most powerful of the four. It borders the principality of Corpus de Jure, which is a friendly yet barren nation where the citizen&#39;s smiles are just a little too big. The last of the three major nations, Humanitas Ex Niliho, is a political hellscape that bends to the will of its dictator, a crazed, environmentally-obsessed madman. Surrounding the island is a recently incorporated band of thugs (who have named themselves xX420levinland69Xx), who are very handsome but ultimately couldn&#39;t care less about any laws or regulations within Audentes. Where will you live?
