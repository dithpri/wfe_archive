An island of five nations, attempting solemnly to live in harmony. The peaceful, beautiful nation of Novi Libertas is the largest and most powerful of the five. It borders the principality of Corpus de Jure, which is a friendly yet barren nation where the citizen&#39;s smiles are just a little too big. The last of the major nations, Humanitas Ex Niliho, is a political hellscape that bends to the will of its dictator. Recently, a group of these citizens have bloodily seceded into anarchy-like Re Litus. Surrounding the island is a recently incorporated band of thugs (who have named themselves xX420levinland69Xx), who are very handsome but ultimately couldn&#39;t care less about any laws or regulations within Audentes.
