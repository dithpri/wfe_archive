An island of six nations, attempting solemnly to live in harmony. The peaceful, beautiful nation of Novi Libertas is the largest and most powerful of the five. It borders the principality of Corpus de Jure, which is a friendly yet barren nation where the citizen&#39;s smiles are just a little too big. The last of the major nations, Humanitas Ex Niliho, is a political hellscape that bends to the will of its dictator. Recently, a group of these citizens have bloodily seceded into a new nation, Re Litus, which has since divided into three new nations: the original, theocracy Rea Litus and police state Corvi Eronus.
