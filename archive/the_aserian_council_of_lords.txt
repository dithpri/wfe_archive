The Council of Lords is a council that seeks to unite the Lordships of Aserlandia. Founded by The Grand Duke at the advice of the other Lordships in the country, The Council was formed in a time of great peril and chaos in Aserlandia. Thanks to their brilliant efforts, stability has been reached in Aserlandia, and can peacefully maintain itself, for now.
