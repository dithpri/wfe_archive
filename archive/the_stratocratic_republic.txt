The Stratocratic Republic is a region catering to military-minded nations.

Containing two houses, one democratically-elected and another containing members of the highest Defense Forces, the Stratocratic Republic prioritizes a balance between fair democracy and military complexes. To join the lower house, you must be elected, and to join the upper house, you must be active and participate in our Armed Forces.

Even if your nation has a small military, you will be welcomed in the Stratocratic Republic, as democratic debate is highly welcomed and on par with our reverence to militarism.
