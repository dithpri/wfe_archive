Discovered on December 1st, 201AD, by our religions founder, Freddie, after our great Lord Gibby led him here. The Island of Carly is a moderately sized island located in the North Pacific, full of rich resources and great forests. The Island of Carly is the Holy Land of our Lord Gibby. Make sure not to eat the poisonous berries on the shore. Our great founder Freddie mistook them for grapes.
