A Continent ravaged by war. The Dowrian Empire, once controlling much of the land on the continent, was caught in a downward spiral of civil war, independence movements, and invaders from all sides. This Empire&#39;s fall, however, has allowed other States to rise from the ashes. The Kingdoms of Apraxia, Acrussia, Dustren, Ufros, and Aldisi are only a few of the states that rose. The Empire has managed to halt it&#39;s territorial losses and is still a major power on the continent, in spite of it&#39;s bruised prestige. All the Nations on the continent wish to claim the Empire&#39;s former glory for themselves.
