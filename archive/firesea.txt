Firesea is a region encompassing nations who just want to watch the rest burn, we do like shooting things, but for the sake of our people, if the rest burn, we begin making our place a beautiful home. This land is a fallout, desert, inhospitable barren wasteland, we plan to take whatever we can and settle some places to live in, and have the biggest arsenal of all. We don&#39;t hate minorities, LGBT, or anything, we just want survival first, any nation is welcome, as long as they are keen on having a powerful military.
