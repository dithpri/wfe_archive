Welcome to TAWHH!

Hello, I&#39;m the founder of The Alternate World History Hub! and I give you a warm welcome to my home! this is a new region... with only one nation to date, but I will make it grow and you can do it too! so if you had decided to join, perfect! I will give you the details! TAWHH... yes I will change that acronymn eventually, it&#39;s a region in which you can RP in an alternate 1950&#39;s! and form your own nation and history, it will even have effect on the region as I plan to make this RP a little bit &quot;realistic&quot; in the way that it will have effects on the region itself and not just in the RP. of course this might change if it gets messy, but for now it will stay like this! without further ado, you&#39;re welcome to join TAWHH!
