One evening an old Cherokee told his grandson about a battle that goes on inside people. He said, &amp;quot;My son, the battle is between 2 &amp;quot;wolves&amp;quot; inside us all.

One is Evil. It is anger, envy, jealousy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego.

The other is Good. It is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith.&amp;quot;

The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather: &amp;quot;Which wolf wins?&amp;quot;

The old Cherokee simply replied, &amp;quot;The one you feed.&amp;quot;
