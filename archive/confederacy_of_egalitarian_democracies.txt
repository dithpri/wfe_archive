[b]Welcome to the Confederacy of Egalitarian Democracies![/b]
We are a group of nations that follow a common theme. We support equality for all people, regardless of race, creed, gender, sex, or ideology. We also tend to lean left, but other than that we&amp;#39;re pretty different.

[b]Quote of the Week:[/b]
&#147;You&amp;#39;re captives of a civilizational system that more or less compels you to go on destroying the world in order to live. &#133; You are captives&#151;and you have made a captive of the world itself. That&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s at stake, isn&amp;#39;t it?&#151;your captivity and the captivity of the world.&#148;
