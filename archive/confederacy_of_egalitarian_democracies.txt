Where is my home?
It&amp;#39;s among the mountains, the cold winds, and the rushing rivers.
Where the harvests are bountiful and the people kind.
The place where the shifting seasons set the pines to shiver.
Where arms lay unused, and coal and uranium unmined.
The Egalitarian Confederacy, that&amp;#39;s my home.

Not! Because The Egalitarian Confederacy is an organisation, not a place.
