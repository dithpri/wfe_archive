Welcome to this region, full of damn dirty commies. That&amp;#39;s right, we&amp;#39;re here, we&amp;#39;re queer, and we are just itching to strip you of your rights and regulations and shove you into a mold of equality. So suck it! You are now part of the state, and your boss is telling you that there is no other way! You, sir, are doomed to a life of fraternity. Ha.
