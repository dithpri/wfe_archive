The Region of [region]Freedonia[/region] is truly glorious. Freedonia is currently built of 6 nations, built upon the ideals of every man is equal, and Freedonia is the best and there is nothing you can do about it. We don&#39;t really take things seriously (or do we?). But on a more serious note, we would like to thank everyone who has helped this nation become what it is now. Therefore, we are giving thanks to: Our # 1 in charge, Adam L. Our #2 in charge, Andrew S. Our # 3 in charge and WA Delegate, Evan K. Our Border Control Manager, Kasra S. Our Minister of Informing the Public, Nico S. Along with some of our founding members, Andrew S, Nico C, Evan K, Kasra S, and Justin D.
&quot;Hail Freedonia&quot;
