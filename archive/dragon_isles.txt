Welcome To The Dragon Isles!

After many decades of war, destruction and death; through the loss of countless lives, both dragons and humans. A truce was proposed by both parties, both seeking common ground and a way to end this terrible struggle; a struggle that many saw as being pointless. It was thus agreed upon that a region would be set up where both dragons and humans could coexist in peace and harmony. The Dragon Isles was thus formed as a result of a peace agreement between the dragons and humans.
