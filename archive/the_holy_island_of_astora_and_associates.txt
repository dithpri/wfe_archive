The Holy Island of Astora, and Associates, consists of the Most Holy Island of Astora, the greatest island there is, and other smaller surrounding islands. Many of the nations in this region used to be part of the Divine Autocratic States Of Scandia, before many of its national leaders vanished from existence, resulting in the downfall of the region and its countries.

The countries of The Holy Island of Astora, and Associates, pride themselves on self-determination, and don&#39;t interfere with the other countries business, even though they have vastly different ideologies. Why? Because it is within the Astorian culture a saying which says: &quot;For each man to his own, his own people to oppress&quot;.
