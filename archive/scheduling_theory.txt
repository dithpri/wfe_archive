From Wikipedia: 

&amp;quot;In computing, scheduling is the method by which threads, processes or data flows are given access to system resources (e.g. processor time, communications bandwidth). This is usually done to load balance and share system resources effectively or achieve a target quality of service. The need for a scheduling algorithm arises from the requirement for most modern systems to perform multitasking (executing more than one process at a time) and multiplexing (transmit multiple data streams simultaneously across a single physical channel).&amp;quot;
