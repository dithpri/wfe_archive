[b]Introduction[/b]

The region of Glavia takes place in a alternate reality where Europe is the only continent on the planet Earth. The people of this new Earth also decided to name Europe to Glavia instead due to religious, and cultural differences in this reality. With all of that being said, Glavia is a mostly dictatorship nation, where leaders take charge of their nation and do so with it how they please. However, some democratic nations exist.
