IRELAND has been liberated and defended with the help of our good friends and allies. 
Invaders were allegedly from:
[region]The Kingdom of Great Britain[/region] with assistance from [region]HYDRA Command[/region], [region]The Chaos Brigade[/region], [region]Empire of Russia[/region].

You &quot;raided our cookie jar&quot; and all you got was last night&#39;s toilet fudge. Our knees shall remain UNBENT and you can tell your silly [nation=short]King-Emperor George VI[/nation] to keep off our soil.

[color=red]*Nations within the region are required to render their endorsement to our Delegate/Prime Minister: [nation=short]Cu Mara[/nation] or face IMMEDIATE ejection.
There will be no forewarning or playing about with this (as was done in the past). We have just undergone an invasion and cannot afford to risk any further security threats to the region.[/color]
