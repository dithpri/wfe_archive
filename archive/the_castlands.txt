[b]This pitiful confederation of petty tribes is brought to you by [url=https://ashesashes.org]Ashes Ashes[/url], a show about systemic issues, cracks in civilization, collapse of the environment, and, if we&#39;re unlucky, the end of the world. (But if we learn from all of this, maybe we can stop that! The world might be broken, but it doesn&#39;t have to be.)[/b]
