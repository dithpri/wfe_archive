&quot;People of Menahar, for too long have you been oppressed. You have been oppressed by those wishing to change you, to warp you into something you are not. But now, we have hope. Join the Wehrian Empire in order to protect Menahar for once and for all.&quot; - Wev Wehri XXXII.

Menahar is a region of wonder and of magic. Sorcerers populate the kings&#39; courts and their battlefields. Great cities, full of grand structures that reach the heavens, that is what you will find here.
