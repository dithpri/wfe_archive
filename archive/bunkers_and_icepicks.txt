[b]Welcome to Bunkers and Icepicks! This is an all-inclusive but majorly non-sectarian left-wing region for the &quot;[i]anti-woke[/i]&quot;and [i]&quot;politically incorrect[/i]&quot; left; note that this and other Regions are defended by the Anti-Fascist Protection Unit.

We welcome Comrades of all stripes, from [color=red]Marxist-Leninsts[/color] to [color=orange]Anarchists[/color] to [color=purple]Trotskyists![/color] to [color=green]Greens[/color]. Despite the name, we have no hostility towards Trotsky.

We highly encourage member nations to get involved both online and offline and have listed a collection of podcasts, YouTube channels, subreddits, real-life organizations, and more to participate in and join.

Rules: No bigotry. We accept embassies from all except Fascists.[/b]
