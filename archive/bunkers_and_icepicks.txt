[b]Welcome to Bunkers and Icepicks! This is a non-sectarian left-wing region for the &quot;[i]anti-woke[/i]&quot;, [i]&quot;politically incorrect[/i]&quot;, or [i]&quot;dirtbag&quot;[/i] left. As dirtbag leftists, we reject politeness, civility, and respectability in favor of edginess, humor, and shock value. See our factbook entry on the anti-pc left for more details!

We welcome leftists of all stripes, from [color=red]Marxist-Leninsts[/color] to [color=orange]Anarchists[/color] to [color=purple]Trotskyists![/color] Despite the name, we have no hostility towards Trotsky.

We highly encourage member nations to get involved both online and offline, and have listed a collection of podcasts, YouTube channels, subreddits, real life organizations, and more to participate in and join.

Rules: No bigotry. We accept embassies from all except Fascists.[/b]
