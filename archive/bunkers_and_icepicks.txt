[b]Welcome to Bunkers and Icepicks! This is a non-sectarian left-wing region for the &quot;[i]dirtbag[/i]&quot; or [i]&quot;politically incorrect[/i]&quot; left. As dirtbag leftists, we reject politeness, civility, and respectability in favor of edginess, humor, and shock value. See our factbook entry on the dirtbag left for more details!

We welcome leftists of all stripes, from [color=red]Marxist-Leninsts[/color] to [color=orange]Anarchists[/color] to [color=purple]Trotskyists![/color] Despite the name, we have no hostility towards Trotsky.

We highly encourage member nations to get involved both online and offline, and have listed a collection of podcasts, YouTube channels, subreddits, real life organizations, and more to participate in and join.

Please read our rule list here before joining![/b]
