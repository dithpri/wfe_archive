Have you ever wanted to direct messages to someone while making them public, but you&#39;d rather not spam your region&#39;s RMB for that? Then the [B]Public Telegrams[/B] is what you need!
This is also an easy way to send a message to multiple nations at once without stamps, if you don&#39;t mind it being public, that is.

Rules:

- All RMB messages must contain at least one nation as a recipient. Use [nation][/nation] tags. Bonus points if you start your message with [B]To:[/B], followed by a list of recipients.
- If you&#39;re using a puppet, it is advisable that you add [B]From:[/B], followed by your main nation&#39;s name, or whatever identity of yours that&#39;s most recognizable.
- Breaking [url=https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=260044]NationStates rules[/url] when writing public telegrams will get you banned from the service&#39;s RMB.
