The great region of Hush was founded by our great Motherland, the Republic of Fenchurch. The first World Assembly delegate, the Queendom of Flycatcher, an ally of Fenchurch was appointed soon after. Two weeks later, to appease the opposition to the current public servants, the Republic of Gitrog was appointed as the vice delegate. Hush is highly exclusive, but it has a diverse host of member nations.
