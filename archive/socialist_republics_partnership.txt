The Socialist Republics Partnership (SRP) is a region for Democratic Socialist nations to come together in unity and cooperation.  The focus of this region is on democratic socialist principles and international partnership.  The SRP believes that the economy and society should be democratically governed in order to meet basic human needs and not so that mega corporations or the rich might make huge profits.  We advocate reforms that will benefit and empower the common working people.
