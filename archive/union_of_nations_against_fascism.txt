[b]This region, formerly the property of [region]Schutzstaffel Brazil[/region], was captured by the excellent comrades from [region]Argentina[/region] and [region]Uruguay[/region]. It now flies their flag as well as that of the region&amp;#39;s new owners, [region]The Union of Nations Against Fascism[/region], and will henceforth act as the UNAF backup region in case of times of strife. Muchos gracias, Argentina and Uruguay![/b]
