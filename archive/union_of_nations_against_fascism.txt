The [b]Union of Nations Against Fascism[/b] was an antifascist organization on NationStates loosely oriented towards anti-Stalinist leftism. UNAF or TUNAF participated in many raids on Nazi and other ultranationalist regions, as well as helping to defend important antifascist regions. It underwent a number of leadership changes before being unknowingly handed to a member of [region]NAZI EUROPE[/region]/[region]BLITZKRIEG[/region] and [region]the Greater German Reich[/region].
