This region was occupied by [region]The North Atlantic Ocean[/region], a firmly Zionist region. It has now been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b] and, of course, in solidarity with the [b][color=green]Palestinian people![/b][/color]

State of Palestine will be handed over to a Palestinian player or a play with connections to Palestine interested in controlling it. I ask two things:
*that you not be anti-Semitic or completely against the state of Israel.
*that you support Palestine&amp;#39;s right to exist, of course :)
