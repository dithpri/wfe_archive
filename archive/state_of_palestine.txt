This region was occupied by [region]The North Atlantic Ocean[/region], a firmly Zionist region. It has now been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b] and, of course, in solidarity with the [b][color=green]Palestinian people![/b][/color]

The politics of hatred and violence are banned here, whether they be in the style of Kach or Hamas.
