```The Eastern Pacific Armada sensed some unusual suspicious activity in your region and we decided to send a patrol out.

As our sailors practiced navigating the international waters, we saw a mysterious object in the water.

It looked like a meteor, but it floated unlike what one might be expect. Sensing abnormalities afoot, our newest sailors took aim with their barrels and blasted it out of the water

If you would like to enlist with the EPSA to blast things out of the water, come join us!
