North Democratic Oil Concord

Countries across the world are led by ruthless dictatorships, monarchies, and corrupt governments. To usurp these corrupt leaders is to bring justice to the world. This is the principal the North Democratic Oil Concord stands for: the removal of non-democratic governments from power. 

We are an alliance of nations that believe that a country is dead without democracy, and we will do everything in our power to promote democracy in the world. 

Once we annex these corrupt governments and replace them with a more democratic one, we also seize the countries&#39; oil. We do this to help the country grow, as well as to help the American people.
