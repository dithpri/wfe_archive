A long time ago (not in a galaxy far, far away, unfortunately) a man *triggered feminist noises* discovered a land of great prosperity, whatever that means. What was his name? No clue, it was like 7000 years ago but it was known as the Great Purcelands, home to the great kingdoms (or Purce&#39;s) over somewhere north of the Mediterranean. Now, what was so great about them, you didn&#39;t ask? No clue, I can&#39;t be bothered to think of a cool backstory, now shut up and join, password is Urmombtw.
