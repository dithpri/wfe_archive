As a historical reference, the Founder will keep the original words that gave born to this region.

&quot;This region has been created as a consequence of the degeneration happened in the TCR, where the WAD leaded an inherently inconsistent anticommunist policy, oppressing the genuine socialist nations there.
Any marxist nation is welcome here, and will be granted a safe and comfortable place to stay.&quot;

After 9th March 2013 the TCR has been liberated, and all the unfairly banned comrades rehabilited.
Thus 9th March shall now on be regional festivity.
