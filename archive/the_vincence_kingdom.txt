[b][i][color=teal]Welcome to[/color] [region]The Vincence Kingdom[/region]![/i][/b] [b]A region renowned for its [color=green]mad bear overlords[/color] and its [color=grey]cool spaceships[/color], we are probably the best region around for roleplay, card trading, and just all around fun stuff! There is so much to do here, like taking a walk on [color=indigo]the beaches[/color] or taking a [color=ocean]swim in the waters[/color]. When you don&#39;t feel like that, why don&#39;t you [color=sepia]watch a movie[/color] with some delicious [color=butterscotch]buttered popcorn![/color] Don&#39;t forget to [color=pink] endorse[/color] our WA Delegate [nation]Plus Nova Imperii[/nation] and [color=red]worship[/color] Supreme Overlord, [nation]Haruhi Japan[/nation]! (or be [color=red] e a t e n[/color].)[/b]
