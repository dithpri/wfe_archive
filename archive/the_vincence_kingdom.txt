Apparently, this was a region both [region]The Wooloo Pact[/region] and [region]The Anti Fascism Alliances[/region] were at war with for whatever reason [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1419689]as seen here[/url]. I decided to help myself to it, since it was sitting there unprotected and free. Looks like they were too busy targeting me to notice that another region they had declared war on had CTEd entirely.
