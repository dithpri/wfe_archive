a.k.a. The Chetkoski Isles

[b]Novoy-Itroscha, meaning &amp;quot;New Islands&amp;quot;, is the new world location of the nation of Chetkosk, thrust back into reality as an independent region following The Cataclysm. Warped in time, built anew from the ashes of revolution and war, the Federal Republic strives to reintegrate itself into the world.
