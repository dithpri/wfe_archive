[i]&quot;Men, we are the first, last and often only line of defence the Imperium has against what is out there. You and that fine piece of Imperial weaponry you hold in your 
hands is all that is keeping humanity alive. Most of you will probably not live to see your second year in the Guard and most of you will probably never see your 
homeworlds again, but I can guarantee you that when you do fall, with a prayer to the most high and mighty God-Emperor on your lips, you will have earned the right 
to call yourself a man!&quot;
