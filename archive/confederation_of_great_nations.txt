What&#146;s this waking you up from your much needed sleep? Why it&#146;s none other than those pesky  raiders from [region]The Black Hawks[/region] and [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region] crashing through your region and making loud noises late at night. How rude of them! Don&#146;t they understand the importance of beauty sleep? &amp;gt;:(

Oh well. Better get some good earplugs I guess&#133;
