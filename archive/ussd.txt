We are the United Soviet Socialist Dictatorships, a split-off region of the [url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=display_region/region=coalition_of_sovereign_nations?start=0]Coalition of Sovereign Nations[/url]. We follow the same ideals as the Coalition. With one clear exception, being that WA nations are not allowed to enter the region. Likewise, any region proposing the construction of embassies with the USSD (with the exception of the Coalition), will be automatically rejected if they contain any WA nations.
