We are the [i]United Soviet [color=red]Socialist[/color] Dictatorships[/i], an allied region of the [url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=display_region/region=coalition_of_sovereign_nations?start=0]Coalition of Sovereign Nations[/url]. We follow the same ideals as the Coalition. With a clear rule, being that WA nations are not allowed to enter the region. If you are not a WA nation, and are interested in joining, I will consider giving the regional password to you. Likewise, any region proposing the construction of embassies with the USSD, will be immediately rejected if they contain any WA nations(with the exception of the Coalition). Also... no fascists allowed.
