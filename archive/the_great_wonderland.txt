[Color=purple]Welcome[/color] to The [color=blue]Great Wonderland[/color]!
Where the [color=green]flowers[/color] are [color=yellow]bright[/color] and the [color=blue]people[/color] are [color=yellow]brighter[/color], 
and where [color=purple]hats[/color] are [color=red]insane[/color], 
and [color=pink]cats[/color] can disappear and reappear.

[color=orange]It&#39;s almost Halloween![/color] Not to mention, the NS Apocalypse!
Have no fear though Wonderland!
There will be enough [color=pink]sweets[/color] and [color=red]candy[/color] to go around that will last us the entire Apocalypse!
[color=red]There will also be enough spooky clowns and zombies for us to obliterate[/color] or [color=green]enclose them and douse them with a cure![/color]
[color=purple]All shall be well this year, Wonderland! To glory, with compassion![/color]
