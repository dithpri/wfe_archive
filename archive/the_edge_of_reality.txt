Reality&amp;#39;s Edge is where realities meet and discontinuities are continuous. Half used stories and backdrops gently fade out of existence. Fractal realities crack out of the aether to be born. Echos of great civilizations, with whole peoples, regions, and universes, die an infinitely slow death through all time. Frozen nations float in the void, parallel universes are contained, and paradoxes coexist.

This is the place where infinity turns, where everything that must happen happens, and is the last resting place before the end.
