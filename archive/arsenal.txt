Liberated from weird vampire Nazi types; this former &#147;Military Stronghold&#148; of [region]Angvar[/region], is held by those that wish hate no place to take root.

Angvar Nazi&#39;s came originally from [region]KAISERREICH[/region]- this region shall not be able to erase its fascist history as easily as they wish. 
[region]Montealba[/region][region]Order of the Southern North[/region] and [region]Novus Lucidum[/region] have elected to become allies and apologists for the fascists. 

Hopefully NL will wake up from the nightmare it selected for itself.

An Administrative Holding of [region]The Wolf Clan[/region].
