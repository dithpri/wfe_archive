This region is basically in an alternate universe where Atlantis was real or at least wasn&amp;#39;t destroyed, instead the Greek gods (Basically Supernatural people that can control things) wiped out the rest of Humanity and focused on Atlantis thus making Europe, America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania sink. And Atlantis is more like the Greeks in the Ancient times, though since some things that were required to advance the world like gunpowder of nuclear stuff are gone the Atlantis can only go up to Steel. The empire though fell after the Cities wanted independence and had personal guards become the cities military and thus taking villages in Atlantis so they can make their own country, making the Atlantic Empire fall into dust (not really)
