Tiny Realm of the Giant was once known only as the region of Extravagant Meadows of Rasse. Rasse&#146;s laws allow many freedoms to its people. The people of Rasse all share the same amount of power. With these freedoms, Rasse&#146;s citizens are allowed to do whatever they wish.
Recently, some citizens have been annoyed with Rasse&#146;s absence of laws so they broke off and formed The Colony of Civil Rasse. Civil Rasse is much more controlling. Civil Rasse is a member of the WA, which Rasse refused to do from the fear of being told what to do. 
The Principality of Unholy Scant was formed by citizens who were tired of supporting these refugees.  Unholy Scant has a large military forming, with required military service from all citizens.
