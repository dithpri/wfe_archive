[url=http://amberandchaos.net/?page_id=73][B][color=black]Stop supporting your destroyers. Don&#39;t accept their philosophy. Your destroyers hold you by means of your endurance, your generosity, your innocence, and your love. Don&#39;t exhaust yourself to help build the kind of world that you see around you now. In the name of the best within you, don&#39;t sacrifice the world to those who will take away your happiness for it.

The world will change when you are ready to pronounce this oath:[/color]
[color=goldenrod]I swear by my Life and my love of it that I will never live for the sake of another man,
nor ask another man to live for the sake of mine.[/color][/B][/url]
