Who is he anyway?
Objectivist nations unite and allow us to kickstart a new, limited, government and allow our nations to be self-determined. In this region you will not be made a slave and will be allowed to make proposals without fear of persecution. We look to the glory of Ayn Rand to guide us to victory over the parasites and those that would hold us back. We are host to some of the finest corporations and nations that will work to improve themselves and by extension society. Join us and form what this nation will be.
 Join us and build a wonderful new world of peace and economic strength. Reject the notions of evil and join a nation of believers.
