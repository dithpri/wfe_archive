Welcome to Arelis, The Kingdom of the Empty Throne. Though the Royal Family may be long extinguished, a Steward now holds court in this once-mighty city, and there shall be glory in Arelis once again!

For the time being, the Region is closed until the Steward can ensure public order and prosperity.
