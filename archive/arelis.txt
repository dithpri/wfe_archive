Once a mighty city-state that dominated the Glass Desert from it&#39;s position on the precipice of the Canyon of Ghosts, it fell to enviromental change and civil war milennia ago. The ruins stand tall, weathering the test of time and remaining, largely, unplundered. Inhabited by dangerous and aggressive wildlife and with few sources of water nearby, few expeditions to the ruins have lasted long, and fewer still have even one member escape. And it is said by the superstitious that the ghosts of the Arelian people do not take kindly to intrusion. Arelis has long since taken on the cruel nickname &#39;The Kingdom of the Empty Throne&#39;.
