[b]A proud colony of fallen Kantrias[/b]

Seven gates for seven brothers, broken by the sword
Six towers of solitude, falling as the brothers warred
Five walls of shattered stone, built against the tide
Four broken monoliths, marking where the heroes died
Three silver fountains, flowing with the canyon&#39;s blood,
Two looted palaces, that couldn&#39;t stand against the flood
One citadel of silence, severed by the past,
Will see another battle before it breathes its last
