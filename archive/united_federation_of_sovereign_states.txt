The United Federation of Sovereign States (or UFSS for short) is a league of sovereign republics, democracies, monarchies, and dictatorships that cooperate and work together for the betterment of all; all members&#39; opinions are considered, even the crazy or not particularly helpful ones; we&#39;re all in this together, which means that I&#39;m here to help, and the rest of the region is, too, hopefully.

Just try not to be mean, or troll, or harass people, or give random people the entrance password or anything. I&#39;ll kick those who do any of those things (except the being mean thing; I&#39;ll give people second chances)

Anyways, have fun!
