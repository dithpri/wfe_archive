Greetings! You may be asking what on Earth the United Stellar Nations is. Well if so you are in luck as I am going to explain about it (even if you weren&#39;t asking).

We are a region founded in the Milky Way galaxy, more specifically on the Moon. Our region covers a huge portion of the Moon, the other portion is widely unexplored and dangerous, most nations of the Earth are also in this union as it greatly benefits countries as they have access to many rare types of space rocks.
