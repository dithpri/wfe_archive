&amp;#127808;[color=Green]Welcome to Glasbhealach RP[/color]&amp;#127808; In this RP the world is different, the British empire never rose because instead it was Ireland that united not just the British isles but also the other Celtic nations and created a globe spanning Celtic empire along with its other allies and enemies, but what will you contribute to this alt history, will you help unite the world or further divide it?
