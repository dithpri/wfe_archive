[b]Hearken now, sons of the cellar, to an age, long ago, and the tale, boldly told, of the one! 

Who was kin to both griphons, and the races of man, with a power to rival the sun! 

And the Voice, he did wield, on that glorious field, when great Maygasse shuddered with war! 

Mighty &amp;#39;I was des&amp;#39;, like a blade, cut through enemies all, as the Bartgeier issued his roar![/b]
