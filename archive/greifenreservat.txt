the last of the mighty griffins... the griffins represent a real life pen &amp; paper role playing group (club) from Austria, all close friends in RL.
The griffins distrust discord; we also are not members of the WA, as membership influences the stats of member nations. In addition, we think of the WA (the SC even more so) as widely abused and unfair to smaller regions due to the operative system of the voting process, where delegates get the votes of their whole region as a surplus, thus doubling them at will (automatically) as a result.
