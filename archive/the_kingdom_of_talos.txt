The Kingdom of Talos is an authoritarian unitary state ruled by a monarch. Forged from the blood of the failing Kingdom of Skyrim by High King Ulfric Stormcloak after his stunning victories over the Imperial Loyalists, and then the Empire of Cyrodiil itself.


Our patron deity is Talos and we believe in the right of all peoples to self-rule and freedom of religion. Our armies sail all over the world to protect natives from imperialist aggression.
