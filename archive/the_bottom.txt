CLAIMED AND CONTROLLED BY [nation]Communist Lukania[/nation]

Nestled within the caldera of a dormant volcano, The Bottom is the capital of the island of Saba. Situated at a relatively low altitude compared to the surrounding volcanic cliffs, the town is shielded from the strong winds and extreme weather of the open ocean. Despite its small size, The Bottom boasts striking views of lush green mountains and the surrounding Caribbean Sea.
