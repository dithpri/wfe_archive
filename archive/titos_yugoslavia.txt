Tito famously said of Yugoslavia, &amp;quot;I am the leader of one country which has two alphabets, three languages, four religions, five nationalities, six republics, surrounded by seven neighbours, a country in which live eight ethnic minorities.&amp;quot;
All nations who mourn for the second, socialist Yugoslavia and hope for a third Yugoslavia are welcome here! Any others are welcome so long as they do not disrespect Marshal Tito!
