Up from ruin in a nation torn from cruel leadership, Eldror, still weak from blows, but growing, rose from the ashes of war.  The Eldrorian government created a fair government, with rising freedoms and economy.  Although still small, Eldror is a nice, fair environment, unlike their neighbor- the Rogue Nation of Enchilada Cats.  (P.S. Cats are the national sign of awesomeness!)
