Dictatorships are not welcome here. Anyone else feel free to move in.

Also, we do not believe in joining the World Assembly at the moment, so don&amp;#39;t worry about any U.N. style BS here. No power plays for regional control to worry about. Although that may change if enough people move in and request it.

Any residing country that wishes to update the region&amp;#39;s: factbook, maps, flags, etc..
Your advice &amp;amp; recommendations will be taken into serious consideration. And if I like the majority of your ideas you may be given regional control to implement the changes as you see fit.
