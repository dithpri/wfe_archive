Once upon a time there was the ancient Calrad Empire, that spanned from the the deserts of the Sarranid Sultanate to the shore of Swadia, and from the cliffs of the Nords to the mountains of the the Rhodoks. Many great cities flourished. But conflict had gripped the land ever since, with the founding of the Republic of Free Swadia and the Invasion of the Morduu and the People of North Ivalice. But New Calradia is now in the modern world. With a new globalized economy, and one of the largest times of peace since the Calrad Empire, and greater emphasis on creating a better world, hopefully New Calradia will grow and stand the test of time as a great region. Or so we hope...
