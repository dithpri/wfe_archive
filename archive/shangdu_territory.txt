The ShangDu Territory is carved up with an equal amount of land and sea masses covering a diverse range of climates. However, this new region is located very far making it almost isolated from the rest of the entire global community. While much of it is practically virgin territory, there is already one nation that has been established, the UPA (United Prefects of Appia).
