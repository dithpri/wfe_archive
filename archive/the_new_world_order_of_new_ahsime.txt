Welcome my fellow Rulers, you can look at this new order as if I am Augustus Caesar and you all are the countries that have been annexed into the Roman Empire. You all still have complete and utter control over your respective countries. This region is almost a democracy the only regional officer that is not elected is the founder and emperor. Be sure to read the rules and blessed be the new world order
