The Emperial Tribunal Of Vandalia has had a turbulent start. But after we put down the coupe we found ourselves in a much better position. This is the new Tribunal under a Emperalistic Democracy Tribunal. We have three commissioners that run the region:

[nation]Empire of the rising cal[/nation]
 -Supreme Comissoner of The Tribunal

[nation]Pimpdonia[/nation] - Commisoner of Foreign affairs and WA delegate 

We will add more positions of power in the future.

LONG LIVE THE TRIBUNAL
