Welcome to the [color=darkorange]International Fascist Federation![/color] We do not believe in the clich&eacute; &#145;Left Wing vs Right Wing&#146; rhetoric nor do we subscribe to racist or anti-semitist sentiment. We are the embodiment of an ideal world draped in nationalism, welfare, and unity. Our beliefs are [b]firm[/b], our altruist goals [b]sincere[/b], and our souls [b]strong [/b]with perseverance and resolve!
