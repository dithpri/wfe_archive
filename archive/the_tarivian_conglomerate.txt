A group of countries brought together by the Empire of New Taritia. The Conglomerate was created with social equality in mind and any nation with sup-par civil rights is rejected. Should any nation in the Conglomerate fall bellow the standard, it is given a short time (approx. 2 weeks) to repair the issue, lest it be ejected from the Conglomerate.
