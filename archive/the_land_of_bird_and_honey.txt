[b][color=0d5eaf]To celebrate the arrival of our new wonderful friends [nation]Voipel[/nation], [nation]Neo Braz[/nation], [nation]Meusa[/nation] and many more, the Thaempirial Army went out on a celebratory tag! We couldn&#39;t have so much fun on our own though, so we invited our lovely friends from [region]Europeia[/region] to join us &amp;#128516; Thanks to this region for allowing the two regions to celebrate friendship publicly!
