
Quastria is an Earthlike world in sector 15a of the Cydronar system, notable for being the only habitable planet in said system. It consists of three large continents, with many outlying islands of substantial size. Quastaria is a region for democratic countries focused on civil rights and political freedom, in which the leader rules as they would be ruled. If a country&#146;s civil rights or political freedoms fall below Reasonable and are not restored within three days, they will be ejected.

Please kindly endorse our WA Delegate Coenlandiana to prevent coups by other regions and keep Quastria a paradise for democratic regions dedicated to improving the lives of their citizens.
