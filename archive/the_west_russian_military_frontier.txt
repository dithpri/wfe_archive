The West Russian Military Frontier: Where History Lives On  

Step into a land frozen between eras&#151;the West Russian Military Frontier, a stubborn remnant of the Russian Civil War preserved by the iron-willed West Russian Volunteer Army. Here, the year is perpetually 1920, but with diesel engines and satellite phones.   

Travel Advisory:  
- Visa required (application includes a loyalty oath to the &quot;Provisional All-Russian Government&quot;).  
- Currency: Silver rubles (modern cards accepted, but frowned upon).  
- Do NOT photograph military checkpoints&#151;some units still think the war is on.  

Come for the history, stay because the train lines are still sabotaged by partisans!  

&quot;For God, Tsar, and Russia!&quot;
