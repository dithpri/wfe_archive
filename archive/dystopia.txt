A land of industry and progress, of oppression and revolution, of polution and wealth. Dystopia is not a utopia. Dystopia is the land of city states, the land of neo-autocracy, the land of a flooded world destroyed by 21st century capitalism and rebuilt into a monstrours creation.

Will you leader create an Oppressive Empire from your new City State? Or will you revolutionize the world, return to the glorious liberty and democracy before the downfall of man, the great flood and the new ice age?

The choice is yours and the power to make it is well within your hands. Whiel the road will be hard it surely will be totaly worth it!
