The region for trying to roleplay the most tyrannical governments ever.

Please do not try making tyrannical governments in real-life, and respect local laws that protect the safety and freedoms of everyone, and not just a few. It seems NationStates can be a societal stress-buster.

Embassy requests may take longer to process at this time. Sorry about that.
