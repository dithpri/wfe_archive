[b]Welcome to [u]Democratic Underground![/u]

Founded in May 2003, by Goobergunchia, this region was refounded October 2010 by [region]Lone Wolves United[/region] as revenge for the region&amp;#39;s former membership in the vile griefer group, [i]Red Liberty Alliance[/i].[/b]

[b]The region was later stolen from [region]Lone Wolves United[/region] in the Fall of 2013 and remained out of our caring arms for years until 3 August 2015, when we were reunited at last.[/b]
