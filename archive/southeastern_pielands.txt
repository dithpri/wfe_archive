The Southeastern Pielands are located in the southeastern hemisphere of the world, and west of the south pacific. The region is rather small, and is home to only 4 nations as of 2018: North Divill Lamberske, South Divill Lamberske, NoLawz, and Twenty One People. The Southeastern Pielands are open to the idea of accepting new nations (*wink wink* join us). They are well known for their amazing pies of all flavors, for which the region is named.
