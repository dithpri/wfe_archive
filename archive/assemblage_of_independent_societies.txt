Bored with life in regions with their collective warmongering and roleplaying, the Dictator of Scythan crossed treacherous seas and braved the harshest of elements so that they may drive a flag into the ground of one of the rare unclaimed landmasses and establish a region with no collective duties or expectations and where member states may rest in not having to care about anything. 

Our humble region currently holds communists, theocracies, corporatocracies, state capitalists, nanny states and tyrannical regimes all in peaceful coexistence.
