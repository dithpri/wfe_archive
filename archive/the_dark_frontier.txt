Let the fires spark, 
And a new age reign,
A brand new start,
Of fear and pain. 
&amp;#39;Tis the start of a new age,
Where kingdoms burn,
 King will die,
And Queens yearn-
To stop the shadows that kill,
The young, 
And Destroy the ill. 
A new age,
Started by three,
Will mark the end,
And start to write a new page.
All it takes, is the will of a single man, 
To drown you in smoke, 
They are dead, those who ran.
It&amp;#39;s useless, a joke. 
Join us, or die. 
LIVE LONG THE REVOLUTION!
