A region for Haitians, by Haitians.  A place where we can commiserate, share ideas, and goof off to relieve tension.  There are no other active regions themed to Haitian politics, history, and culture here on NationStates...no other region, but the Haitian Union.

Pase yon moman avek nou anba pye mango, bay blag, pale sou nepot bagay.

Non-Haitians are welcome to join as well. Please be respectful of each other here.
