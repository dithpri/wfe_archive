[color=#4edf20]The Duck Alliance is a peaceful gathering of nations with a keen interest in the environment, human rights, and freedom. All nations are welcomed, provided that they do not antagonize other nations.

This region follows a policy of direct democracy where members vote on how the region will address issues. When an ambassador to the WA is elected, members of the region will vote on how s/he will vote on resolution in order to make sure that the ambassador&#39;s position is reflective of that of the region. 

More positions will be created as more nations join.
