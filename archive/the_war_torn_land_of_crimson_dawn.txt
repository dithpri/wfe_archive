The crimson dawn was once a great region before raids and Fools forced it to its knees. Then the darkness of stagnation casted out any chance of the old order regaining control. But now War heroes,pioneers,and survivors will retake this Mystifying land. Once we do this we&amp;#39;ll begin the construction of not just a empire but a entirely new civilization that will stand above all whom dare try contain The everlasting ambition of The Crimson Dawn.
