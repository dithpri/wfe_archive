Terrania is a new region, securely controlled and monitored by several military districts and states. Any form of raider affiliation and/or military action within the region without the consent of the Supreme Marshall is to result in a ban. A regional council will be held on the forum board every Friday, where our own legislation will be discussed and debated, with each joining member having their own vote or say. Multiple members of the same association will not be dealt with, and so shall result in a ban if one or more nations.
