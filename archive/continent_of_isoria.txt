The continent Isoria is the second largest in the world, and consists of a large landmass and two smaller northern islands. Civil, political, and military differences make the region one of the most nationally diverse. Due to its location, Isoria wasn&#39;t affected much by the Sijic Expansion, and makes its technology substantially different from other colonies.
