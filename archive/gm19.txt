[hr]The Militiamen of [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=blue_ridge][color=#46807C][b]Blue Ridge[/b][/color][/url] have grown tired of the mountains, and left Fort Meyer to preach proper orangeist platitudes this update. Led by the noble [color=#46807C][b]Captain-General[/b][/color] [b][nation=noflag]Basshobia[/nation][/b], these most gracious and noble fleets of the Militia have sailed into this region and claimed it for the [color=#46807C][b]Emperorange[/b][/color]. When times of peril came upon, brave [b]Sergeant[/b] Miyamai reenforced our noble bands.
