[u][b]The Lands of Ice and Fire[/b][/u]
The known world is composed of at least three continents ([region]Westeros[/region], [region]Essos[/region], and [region]Sothoryos[/region]), a large landmass ([region]Ulthos[/region]), and a number of many smaller islands. None of the four major landmasses have been completely mapped, and much of the world remains unexplored. While the maesters of [region]Westeros[/region] know a good deal about the lands to the far east, distance is still an issue, and past a certain point myths and legends become a factor in their records.
