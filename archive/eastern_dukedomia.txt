In the simplest terms victory is defined by getting a member of you&amp;#39;re team elected to the position of WA Delegate, once their they have won the game and it is up to the opposing side to try and regain power. The WA Delegate will be free to eject nations of the opposition from the region however if they ban any other nation I will eject and ban them from the region - no mercy shown.
