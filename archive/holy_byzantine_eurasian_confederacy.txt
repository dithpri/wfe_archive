We are neutral and respect for everyone. We can work as a whole of humans to coexist in any world.

Peace and friendship with all mankind is our wisest policy, and I wish we may be permitted to pursue it.

All are free to choose any life path they desire and follow any morals they wish,
providing that their beliefs are always in the interests of the nature and humans as a whole.

We encourage everyone to join our region, and to join our cause!

Attention Residents: You should respect the rules of NationStates and you don&#39;t give your nation (or passwords) in the hands of others!
