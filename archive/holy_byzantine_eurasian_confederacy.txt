ELIBERATED! REORGANIZED!
We are neutral and respect for everyone. We can work as a whole of human species to coexist in any world.

Peace and friendship with all mankind is our wisest policy, and I wish we may be permitted to pursue it.

All nations may enter, the wise remain. All may do as they will and can as they may.

All are free to choose any life path they desire and follow any morals they wish, providing that their beliefs are always for a good mankind and nature.
