Hello there! My name is Tori, and I rule Ginavan. I also run Little Rock Islands. As you read this, I want you to know, I treat all nations fairly, and I expect the same from you. I hope as two nations, you and I might get along well. Now, you must be patient with me, since I am new to this. Thanks for reading, and I hope you join! 
      Have a great day!
                           ~Tori
