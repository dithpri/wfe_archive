The organization of multiple nations of varying ideologies and sizes banding together through a common dedication to being Bumped.
The regional currency is known as the &quot;bumpo&quot;(/b&amp;#601;mp&amp;#333;/) and can be found in the quantity sizes of 0.75, 8, and 19. Because of these particular currency sizes, shopping in the region has mostly been changed to bartering, leaving the bumpo only in use for job wages and banks.
