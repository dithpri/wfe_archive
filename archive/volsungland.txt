Volsungs Unite!

Through hardship and struggle
We have survived through the ages
We have been martyred 
We have been enslaved 
We have been in cages 
Yet our spirit &amp; our might
Couldn&#39;t be tamed
So the fight will carry on
From the old to the young
We will persist 
In our quest for the new dawn
