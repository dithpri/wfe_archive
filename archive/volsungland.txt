It&#39;s a fight to the end be it sword or pen, our people say when at the fall of the hammer. Like a wolf to its den we&#39;re all ready to defend, boys become men at the fall of the hammer.

Who follows rules? Who&#39;s another man&#39;s tool? A wise man or fool at the fall of the hammer. Who likes to bark? Who likes to bite? Who&#39;s prepared to fight at the fall of the hammer?!

Through hardship and struggle, we have survived through the ages.
We had been martyred. We had been enslaved. We had been in cages.

Yet our spirit &amp; our might, couldn&#39;t be tamed.
So the fight will carry on.
From the old to the young, we must persist.
In our quest for the new dawn!
