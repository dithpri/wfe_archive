[b]Southwest Florida[/b] is the region along the southwest Gulf coast of the U.S. State of Florida. The area is known for its sugar white sand beaches, lush tropical landscape, and winter resort economy.

Definitions of the region vary, though its boundaries are generally considered to put it south of the Tampa Bay area, west of Lake Okeechobee, and mostly north of the Everglades and to include Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, Lee, and Collier counties. For some purposes, the inland counties of DeSoto, Glades, and Hendry, and the thinly populated mainland section of Monroe County, south of Collier, are also included.
