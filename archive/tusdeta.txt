Tusdeta is an interstellar society of quite diverse nations.  A mutual defense pact unites all of the region, though many of the Tusdetan societies are averse to armaments, preferring to rely on the quiet vastness of space as an adequate barrier to hostilities.  A trade and mobility pact is also in place to notionally create a shared Tusdetan economy, although it lacks enforcement mechanisms.  Some amount of transit cooperation is available for nations without space programs, though in accordance with the trade pact, all Tusdetan nations are expected to construct space programs when the opportunity arises.
