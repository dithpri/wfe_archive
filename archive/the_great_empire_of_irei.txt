The Great Empire of Irei was founded long ago by the bloodbath survivors from the Great massacre of 2013, brought on by the towering and mighty region of Oatland.

We pride ourselves on the hard-working man born from blood and the blanket of freedom provided. We are ignorant towards religion and encourage scientific advancement at the highest levels.
