From the ashes of the former age rose the phoenix of the Path. The Path has taken control; the governments of the world such as they were have fallen. Path members pledge their lives, energy, and intelligence; in return, they receive security, food, shelter, medicine, recreation and a new life. The Path currently has three Protectorates:

1. The Path Alpha Protectorate (covers territory in both former Australia and Europe, consisting of two outposts and 12 compounds)
2. The Path Beta Protectorate (covers other territory in both former Australia and Europe, consisting of two outpost and 12 compounds)
3. The Path Omega Protectorate (covers territory in former America, consisting of one outpost and six compounds)
