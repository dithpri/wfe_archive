From the ashes of the former age rose the phoenix of the Path. The Path has taken control; the governments of the world such as they were have fallen. Path members pledge their lives, energy, and intelligence to the collective; in return, they receive security, food, shelter, medicine, recreation and a new life. The Path currently has three Protectorates (Alpha, Beta and Omega), information about which can be found in the Factbook.
