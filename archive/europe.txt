[b]Welcome to Europe![/b]

[hr]

One of the most influential NationStates regions, Europe is known for being the biggest and best roleplaying region with over 10 years of history and 1000+ RP posts a month. We invite you to join one of the largest player-created regions today and visit the [url=http://www.europe-game.eu]Forum[/url] to join in RP TODAY!

[hr]

[b]Nations of Europe are encouraged to join the WA and endorse the WA delegate, [nation=short]Imperium Anglorum[/nation]! Every endorsement for the delegate is an extra vote for Europe in the WA![/b]

[b]Attention Regional Recruiters[/b]: Advertising and recruiting in player-created regions is against the rules!
[b]Attention Residents[/b]: There is a draft Constitution for Europe thread on our Offsite Forums open for discussion.

NO RP IN THE REGIONAL MESSAGE BOARD!
