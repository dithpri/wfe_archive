Just like the [color=red]Reddit[/color]. Each day will have a poll featuring a battle scenario, and outcomes can be decided in the RMB/poll results. If anyone wishes to suggest a contest, just telegram [nation]Darkone8[/nation], or let me know in the RMB.
For those in other regions: just quote my daily announcement and let me know who you would like to fight.

Starting 4/27/18:
The RMB is now open as a role-playing arena to mock the current poll. The background is a building containing a wrestling arena, computer room, movie room, and various other rooms and supplies needed to host the fights!
