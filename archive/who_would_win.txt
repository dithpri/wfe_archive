AND WE&#39;RE OPEN AGAIN!!!!!!!

Just like the [color=red]Reddit[/color]. Each day will have a poll featuring a battle scenario, and outcomes can be decided in the RMB/poll results. If anyone wishes to suggest a contest, just telegram [nation]Lound[/nation] [nation]The Rebelling Rebels[/nation], or [nation]Darkone8[/nation], or let us know in the RMB.
For those in other regions: just quote my weekly announcement and let me know who you would like to fight.

[color=blue]If you wish to &quot;unsubscribe&quot; from the daily updates, let me know through RMB or telegram. You must be an officer of high ranking in order to do so.[/color]
