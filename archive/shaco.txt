Welcome! To the newly formed Region of SHACO. 
What does it mean? Well, as the leader of Shamenistan (Shah-men-&amp;#275;estan), this represents my nation and my people at heart. The Sha&#39;ani Coalition.

Because of our religious beliefs, it is in my interest to include my people.
We are still developing, learning and still eager than ever to grow our Region.
May you enjoy your time here.

-Shannon.
