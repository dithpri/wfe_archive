The Virtus Alliance was founded originally by Shlavania Lavinear and Sartinia with several nations joining throughout the years. In 2015 2 of the 3 founding members left and soon collapse Shlavania dissolved the Alliance until 2017 when 2 upstart nations Catlandia, and Roastoria wished to make a alliance with the old Empire of Shlavania. Thus the Virtus Alliance was brought back from the death. Can it live up to the glory of the original.
