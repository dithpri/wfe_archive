Hello. Have a seat. Rest a bit. This is a game, we don&#39;t need it to take over our lives, we have no duty to it. We simply are here to have fun, relax for a few minutes and that&#39;s all. This region doesn&#39;t have much and it&#39;ll probably stay like that, imagine it kind of like a restaurant where you can sit down for a couple of minutes, get something to eat and drink, and have a chat with people.
