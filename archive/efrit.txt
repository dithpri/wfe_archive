Efrit is a newly founded region which is small now but with the right supporters can grow to become a top contender. This region has no set religion or one large view on different key aspects of society. We shall vote on that later after I receive enough ideas and members to join. I shall not always be active so I will appoint someone to oversee the running of this place when I&amp;#39;m not around.
