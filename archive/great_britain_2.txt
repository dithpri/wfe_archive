We are a very big empire. Monty Python is a good show.  I like cheese.  Dogs like cheese and bacon. Also dogs play poker.  Poker is a card game. The queen of Hearts is Margaret Thatcher. Princess Margaret had great legs.  Princess phones are impractical.  Practice practically makes practical.  Not to be confused with Grate Expectations by Sir Edmund Wells.  Edmund Wells also wrote the grate works of Shakespeare.  Shakespeare wrote West Side Story and got all ten wickets in one inning.
