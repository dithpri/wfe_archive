The United Progressive Nations (UPN) is a newly established region for those who seek active discussions and reforms and/or are unable to influence their power in other regions. It intends nations to allow for progressive policies regardless of any factor and is a platform for fellow nations to join and unite under a common banner of unity and prosperity.
