[b]Welcome to [u]Ordo Templi Populares[/u]![/b]

We are dedicated to the doctrine of the godliness of the People and the holiness of all land the People tread on. Hence, the private ownership of land and rule of any kind other than democracy is antithetical to us. The OTP takes influence from the Religion of Humanity of Auguste Comte, Cult of Reason during the French Revolution, Karl Marx&#39;s dialectical and historical materialism and God-Building of Anatoly Lunacharsky and Alexander Bogdanov. The primary aim of Ordo Templi Populares is a holy crusade and subsequent destruction of the [i]Throne of Civilization[/i] and construction of the [i]Temple of the People[/i] in its place.

[b]Join us to become the hands and eyes of God and reclaim the holy land![/b]
