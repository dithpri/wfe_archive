[color=red]This formally fascist region, occupied by [region]The Fascist Union[/region], has been taken out of order several times by various Antifascist organizations, most recently held by [region]Freedom Justice Alliance[/region]&amp;#39;s leader [nation]BlackGreenWhite[/nation].

It has now been transfered to [region]The MT Army[/region], keeping it out of fascist hands for the foreseable future.

We cannot allow hate to spread to the young and impressionable of society, because it will only hurt/slow the progression of humanity in the long run.[/color]

[color=purple]We are [region]ANTIFA[/region] and we are everywhere!
