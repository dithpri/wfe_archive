The Panda Zoo Method
Step One: Send a telegram to current WA delegate expressing interest in being the next WA delegate.(must be in WA fist) 
Step Two: Poll Goes up to Determine Winner (Those with a Governent Postion cannot run)
Step Three: Un-endorse Old WA delegate and endorse New WA delegate 
Step Four: The winner will serve as WA delegate for the next two weeks.
Step Five: New poll goes up, you can run for two terms in a row if you are the current WA delegate. (2 Terms, Then 4 week break).
