[hr]On this momentous day, June 27th 2025, the formation of the august [b][region]Trinity Commonwealth[/region][/b] is inscribed into the annals of history.

United by the ideals of sovereignty, brotherhood, and mutual advancement, the three noble nations &#151; the prosperous [b][nation=long]South Andrimandian[/nation][/b], the resolute [b][nation=long]Liburgo[/nation][/b], and the illustrious [b][nation=long]Strom Stadt[/nation][/b] &#151; solemnly seal a historic pact with honor and conviction.

Bound by shared aspirations for lasting peace, collective prosperity, and the protection of their peoples. May this sacred bond serve not only as a shield against adversity, but also as a bridge to a glorious future, where mutual [b]respect[/b], [b]integrity[/b], and [b]progress[/b] lay the foundation for a new and shared chapter in history.
