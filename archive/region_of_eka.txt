I&#39;m Rick Harrison and this is my pawn shop.  I work here with my old man and my son, Big Hoss.  Everything in here has a story and a price.  One thing I&#39;ve learned after 21 years - you never know WHAT is gonna come through that door.

Here is a poem to enlighten the masses:
Roses are red, Harambe got shot
I&#39;m Rick Harrison and this is my pawn shop.
