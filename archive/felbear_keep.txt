[b][i]Welcome to Felbear Keep, heroes![/b][/i]

This ancient ruin is the last stop on your adventures with [nation=short]Amber the Far Seeker[/nation] before The Palace of Armello. Sana was sent to this dark place by none other than Bear Clan&#39;s Elder Council, to investigate the rumors that an ancient treasure of their Clan lie hidden within. Sana, however, is no treasure hunter and could use some assistance.

This is exactly the type of thing we&#39;ve gone on our journey for! Whichever Clan scores the most points will find the treasure Sana is seeking, earning the gratitude of the Bear Clan forever and this region along with it!
