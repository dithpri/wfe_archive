Nestled in the lush forests, Land of SHIELD is perfect for hideaways. Dense trees provide protection from the harsh sun and canopies that provide relief from heavy rain. There is a subterranean electric fence that is always armed, with citizens inside having to be scanned in order to leave. Captain Lake, which is in the center of the forest, provides water for the area and abilities to sustain a fishing sector. The climate is temperate, with hot summer days, cool fall nights, freezing temperatures during the winter, and rainy spring mornings. The rain helps the plants flourish, with flowers lining the roads to and from each nation, and the crops plentiful during the summer.
