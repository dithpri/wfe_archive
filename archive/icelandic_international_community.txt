[u][b]GOVERNMENT OF THE [region=ICELANDIC INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY][/b][/u]
[b]Status -[/b] Presidental Control [i](Provisional Emergency Government)[/i]

Regional government has temporarily been placed under review by [nation=Ejyafjallajokull], acting President of the [region=Icelandic International Community] under an Emergency Provisional Government. All queries and status updates can be addressed to the President only. A refounding timetable is underway, and it is hoped that all prominent former member nations will be online by 07/12/12. (The Kirkjub&aelig;jarklaustur Stock Exchange and the International Icelandic Kr&oacute;na have been emergency-married to the Swiss Franc in the meantime.) We thank you for your consideration in this matter.
