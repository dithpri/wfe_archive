Far far away in the galaxy...
Two factions were in war. The great republic of Arkaea ruled by humans and elves vs great GI ruled by alien commonwealth.
Who will win this war? Who will you join?
Will you put a mark on the history of galaxy, or just be destroyed by your rival?

Comrade, we are a active roleplaying community on Nationstates and are ready to make our mark! You can join in on the fun and join the canon to blow nationstates away with the URA!
