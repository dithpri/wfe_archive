I was browsing through the dusty and ancient archives of NationStates and came across this [URL=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=644105]previous holding[/URL] of [region]US Military[/region], which was unguarded and had CTE&#39;d. This relic of a bygone era was re-founded on 11/13/19 by the J o Jian Army, and is now another artifact/trophy in J o J&#39;s collection.

[hr]Property of [nation]J o J[/nation].[hr][b][color=red]Oh, and by the way, I still don&#39;t condone The Pacific Hoodlums or The Red Fleet, who took the mainland region of [region]US Military[/region] and its other two holdings. They are even worse than WA multi users.[/color][/b][hr]
