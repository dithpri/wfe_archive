[nation]J o J[/nation] was browsing through the dusty and ancient archives of NationStates and came across this [URL=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=644105]previous holding[/URL] of [region]US Military[/region], which was unguarded and CTEd. This relic of a bygone era was re-founded on 11/13/19 by the J o Jian Army, and is now another artifact/trophy in J o J&#39;s collection. Who doesn&#39;t love to get free stuff?
