This is the region intended for users of the RavenChat IRC network. Anybody is welcome to join, however much activity will be conducted over IRC on that network. Being a new region, we expect to be changing things rapidly over the coming weeks. If you wish to contribute to the development of a region from the ground up, then please, feel free to relocate your nation here.
