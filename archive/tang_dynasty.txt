The Tang Dynasty (618&#150;907 CE) is a pivotal &quot;golden age&quot; in Chinese history, known for immense territorial expansion, economic prosperity, cosmopolitan culture, and significant advancements in arts, literature (especially poetry), and technology, building upon the Sui Dynasty&#39;s foundation to create one of the world&#39;s largest and most influential empires, though it eventually declined due to internal strife and rebellions like the An Lushan Rebellion (755&#150;763).
