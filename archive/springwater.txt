The history of Springwater as a unified kingdom began in the 8th century, but historic documents describe the geographic area and the people living there - the Ramens -, as early as 500 AD. These early documents include the writings of Adoltin and Ranae. With the Toaism of the Ramens c. 960 AD, it is clear that there existed a kingship in Sieno, controlling the current Springwater territory roughly speaking. Andreomeda the Third can trace her lineage back to the Viking kings Fuge the Old and Mickey Elidad from this time, thus making the Monarchy of Springwater the oldest in Upsidedown.
