[Hr][hr][Color=maroon][b]Rome, Italian&nbsp;Roma, historic city and capital of Roma&nbsp;provincia&nbsp;(province), of&nbsp;Lazio&nbsp;regione&nbsp;(region), and of the country of&nbsp;Italy. Rome is located in the central portion of the Italian peninsula, on the&nbsp;Tiber River&nbsp;about 15 miles (24 km) inland from the&nbsp;Tyrrhenian Sea. Once the capital of an ancient republic and empire whose armies and polity defined the Western world in antiquity and left seemingly indelible imprints thereafter, the spiritual and physical seat of the&nbsp;Roman Catholic Church, and the site of major pinnacles of artistic and intellectual achievement, Rome is the Eternal City, remaining today a political capital, a religious centre, and a memorial to the creative imagination of the past.[/b][/color][hr][hr]
