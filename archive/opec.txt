The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is comprised of a group of nations whose energy resources are coveted by all nations. United originally to avoid exploitation by larger nations, OPEC members have formed an economic bloc capable of dictating a precious global commodity. Since its inception, OPEC has enabled member nations to invest in their own social service nets, and especially education, uniting the members in a common belief in social justice (unless, of course, that conflicts with the interests of the state ...). Member nations have since been active in promoting environmentalism with the slogan: &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t let industrial waste destroy the planet; let the oil industry help&amp;quot;.
