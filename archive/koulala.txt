[b][i]Welcome to Koulala![/b][/i]

This is Koulala, a new region founded to be specifically for fun and absolute chaos --not of the [i]bad[/i] kind-- and just have fun! Have a great time and don&#39;t say words people don&#39;t want you saying, and heck, you can stay here [i]for the rest of your time playing Nation States![/i] Just to mind you, this is an alt account of [nation]Kyrudistan[/nation], and that nation is in the World Assembly, so I personally can&#39;t join. Speaking of the World Assembly, join it so you can apply for the WA Delegate! We are in desperate need of one, as you can tell. This region is a LGBTQ supporting region, so, [b][i]please[/b][/i] do not say rude stuff about gay people.

Anyways, have fun at Koulala!
