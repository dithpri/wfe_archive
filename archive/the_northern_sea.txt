[b]The [region]Europeia[/region]n Republican Navy snuck out aboard their newly minted small operations vessel in The Northern Sea, hoping to find an island full of fresh citrus. Not only did we find what we were looking for, but we&#39;re now fully stocked with lime for all of our sailors needs. If you&#39;d like to join our sailors hunting for fruit, we&#39;d love to have you aboard too!
