The National Fascist Party (Partito Nazionale Fascista; PNF) was an Italian party, created by Benito Mussolini as the political expression of fascism (previously represented by groups known as Fasci; see also Italian Fascism). The party ruled Italy from 1922 to 1943 under an authoritarian, totalitarian system.

It is currently the only party whose reformation is explicitly banned by the Constitution of Italy: &amp;quot;it shall be forbidden to reorganize, under any form whatever, the dissolved fascist party&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Transitory and Final Provisions&amp;quot;, Disposition XII) This paragraph may also apply to the later Republican Fascist Party. &#151;Communpedia
