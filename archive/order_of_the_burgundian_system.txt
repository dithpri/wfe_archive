THE WORLD WREAKS OF IMPURE CREATURES ROAMING, PLOTTING TO DESTROY HUMANITY. THE EARTH MUST BE CLEANSED OF THEIR FILTH IF WE ARE TO OBTAIN SALVATION. IT IS THE ONLY WAY. 

Burgundian System:

The Burgundian System is an ideology created by [STRENG GEHEIM] and practiced by [STRENG GEHEIM] colleagues. The ideology is based on the belief that mainstream National Socialism did not go far enough towards establishing Aryan supremacy. The Burgundian System calls for extreme spartanism, which in theory would make the German people stronger through hardship. It is believed that [STRENG GEHEIM] believes in an even more extreme form and wishes to cleanse the world with nuclear fire so that only the Aryan race would survive and repopulate the earth.
