The Communist Workers International is a region for those who are real communists, not just those who play one on NationStates. The CWI is the home for real-world communists playing NationStates. Our politics are important enough to use every possible medium and forum to educate, agitate and organize. We are not &quot;democratic socialists&quot; or any other ideology masquerading as communists. If you wish to join, please do so by clicking on the button below.
