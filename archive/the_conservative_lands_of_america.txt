This is Our Land, We The People. Government is our biggest problem, too much of it is bad, too little is worse. We must make America Great Again! it has to be done soon. We start with our taxes, Lower the better. Taxes will never go above 10%(Unless Desperate), taxes will also never go below 3.5%. We have to insure our nations are safe so 3.7-4.3% of the 10% will be going to defense, another 1.5% will be going to transportation and education, Welfare will take 2.5% of taxes, the last 1.5-2% will go to Industry. We also need  our government to take part in only 5-7% of trade, Black Market 1-10% and 5-15% state owned and 68-88% Private Trade.
