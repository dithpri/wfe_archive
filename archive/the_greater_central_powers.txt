The Central Powers is home to all nation that want to Role play wars and display information about their nation.  Generally try to be a Dictatorship or a puppet of a dictatorship to join we do NOT allow C*mmunists at all.  Otherwise even if you are capitalist join just not too D*mocratic.

Rules are these:  You may not Say on the board, Communist, Socialist, and Democracy.
These are forbidden.
You are also not allowed to express National Socialist ideals or beliefs though if role play you may mention it but NEVER praise it.

Finally have fun, you can be old or new, whatever you want we don&#146;t discriminate according to age, population, or experience ever.  I hope this grows and thanks for reading! :D
