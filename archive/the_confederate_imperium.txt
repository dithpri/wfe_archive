The Confederate Imperium of Sovereign States of America remains on the most power empires of earth. With rebellion in the city of Denver Colorado and the defection of Major General Thomas Stafford to the United American Front, Stafford has gained support from the World Assembly and has been named Chancellor of the UAF. With the recent invasion of the American Fatherland, The Confederate Imperium&amp;#39;s annexation of that country back into the Imperium was a success. The Neutral Zone is still enforced by the World Assembly allowing the UAF to survive the onslaught by the Imperium. Emperor North is becoming impatient.
