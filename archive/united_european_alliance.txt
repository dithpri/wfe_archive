The United European Alliance, the UEA, was founded after the second world war when the great people of europe reliased that one united band of nations would be the only way europe would survive. It was officially founded in 1948 and the alliance&amp;#39;s first task was to rebuild after the devastation caused by the war. The unity of the nations was tested as the world economy collapsed and many nations fell into debt, however, a new system was put in place to invite all nations who wish to come to join the UEA for the betterment of the region.
