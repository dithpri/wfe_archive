Welcome To The Confederation!

A Confederation is a union of states much like a federation, with one large difference.
In a confederation all the states remain independent (meaning they have their own laws, leaders, population, etc.)

In this confederation all states are independent, yet at the same time, They are one.
All nations within the confederation can use a Confederation currency (Reich-Marks), as well as their own. 

Nations are allowed to go to war with each other, but only as a last resort.

All other information can be found below.
