Hello and welcome to Micras! A collection of states existing to dominate the region. Allies or enemies we all endeavour to have a laugh regardless. We have our megalomaniacs, such as the Babkhans, our snooty aristocrats, the Shirithians and the Alexandrians, our old man Antica and some crazy people who believe in flying islands, elves and magic, the Nelagans, Elwynesse and Gralans. Oh and don&amp;#39;t forget the Vikings in Stormark. 

It appears we lost our Nationstates region so I&amp;#39;m starting it up again. Boom.
