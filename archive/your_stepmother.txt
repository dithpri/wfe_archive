[b]WELCOME HOME![/b]

I know I can&#146;t replace [region]your mother[/region], and I know your father&#146;s death was hard, but I&#146;m here to tell you that we&#146;re in this together, and we&#146;re going to get through this together. I created a new region, [u][b][region]Your Stepmother[/region][/b][/u], and you&#146;re all welcome to join. Come on, don&#146;t be shy. Let [nation]Your Stepmother[/nation] take care of you&#133;

Just one rule for this region: Everybody respect everybody else! :)
