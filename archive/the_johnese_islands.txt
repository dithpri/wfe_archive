In 2015, a group of Johnese settlers left their homeland for a better place. They found an uninhabited group of islands and decided to found a new nation there, the Democratic Republic of the Johnese. Any nation is welcome in the Johnese Islands.

The Johnese Islands is a group of 87 islands in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The largest island, John Island, is near the center of the archipelago and holds the capitol of the Democratic Republic of the Johnese.
