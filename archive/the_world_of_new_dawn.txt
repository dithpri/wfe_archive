The World of New Dawn is an RP Region set in a late medieval/fantasy world similar to The Elder Scrolls, Witcher, and Medieval II: Total War. The world is young, yet so aged from wear, and soon, a great global war between benevolent Daemons and their crusaders and the Gods of Heaven will determine the fate of mortalkind.
