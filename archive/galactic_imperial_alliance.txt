The Alliance is ruled permanently by the Emperor, but members of the Alliance can influence and persuade if they want. You&#39;ll want to join, for the Galactic Imperial Alliance will rule the world eventually... You may not have a lot of influence at first, but if you try hard to make the Alliance better, and more powerful, the more influence and respect you have. You don&#39;t increase in rank because of your kissing-up skills, you improve when the Alliance does too. Wanna be the best? Then MAKE it the best.
