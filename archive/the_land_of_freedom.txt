Here you can do whatever you want and make friends and just have fun! We do not go off of nation states statistics, but we do ask that you be reasonable with your self made stats. We mostly do all roles on the discord, ask for link from the founder. Everyone has the the same level of importance here! Anyone can apply to be a regional authority, just ask! You can be denied. If you have any questions please contact the founder[spoiler]Email: lessigneg2002&amp;#64;gmail.com or Discord: Scandinavian Baltics #9011[/spoiler]
