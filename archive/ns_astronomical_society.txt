This is the NS Astronomical Society.  The latest victim of the long-established EPSA drive-by.

WHY?

You posted AdSpam on our RMB a few months ago, and now we got you back.

Apologies to all those I&amp;#39;ve hurt.  This is my last act as EPSA General.  Good luck for the future.  The old WFE has been telegrammed to the founder, because we&amp;#39;re not that mean!

P.S. Many Thanks to [region]The West Pacific[/region] and EPSA members [nation=short]The Dominion of the Rare Commodities[/nation], [nation=short]The Fourth Imperium[/nation], [nation=short]Xoriet[/nation], [nation=short]Nyaa[/nation] and [nation=short]Serene Nation of Rusapore[/nation].
