The Mists is the realm of the afterlife and the proto-reality that exists between the worlds which in turn are the building blocks of reality. They are the home to various gods and other powerful entities and the residences of various afterlives. The Mists resonate from the worlds around them, forming bits of their own reality &#151; islands of existence that reflect the histories of their worlds.
