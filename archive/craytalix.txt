Craytalix is a small landmass in the middle of the pacific ocean, isolated and heavily defended from outside regions. It is almost impossible for new nations to enter, and all nations residing within Craytalix must practice complete neutrality, avoiding engaging in conflict and trade with outsiders. Every nation must be completely self sufficient, or will be in violation of Craytalix&amp;#39;s laws. Any lawbreaking shall result in immediate termination of residency, as well as permanent denial for any chance of reentry.
