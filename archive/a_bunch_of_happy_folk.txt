Yes, we are happy... now go away. Or stay. We really are not that nice. Who are &quot;we&quot; exactly? Well, we honestly don&#39;t know.

Or, perhaps you are part of the &quot;we&quot; during our short interactions. Hm... There is lots to ponder. Why not stay a bit and make up your mind? Please, take your time, though we haven&#39;t got all day.
