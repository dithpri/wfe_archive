[b]Welcome to the Region of Ordis![/b] - Formerly known as Escar (oh my!) Ordis is a closed canon RP region - meaning it is it&amp;#39;s own planet, not associated with the rest of the NS multiverse - focused primarily on MT RP, though PT and even (separate from the main canon of course) FanT and FT RPs have been considered. We&amp;#39;re a friendly bunch, so feel free to drop by an say hello through our embassies!
