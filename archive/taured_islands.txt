The Taured Islands were once underwater, hidden beneath the ocean. But a few years ago, a severe drought in the region caused the water to recede, revealing the islands. Now, most of the landscape is a dry, deserted expanse. However, some small areas have freshwater springs where unique plants and animals manage to survive. The people living there have adapted by growing drought-resistant crops and trading with distant lands. There are old ruins scattered across the islands, hinting at an ancient civilization that once thrived there.
