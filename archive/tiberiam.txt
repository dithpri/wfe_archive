[u][b]Welcome to Region of Tiberiam[/u][/b]

Tiberiam is a region with deep focus on off-site Roleplaying base. In order to stabilize our government, we have locked the region. However, Tiberiam is open to all who are wish to join in our Roleplaying venture.

To gain access to Tiberiam, simply TG the current WA delegate ([nation]Oscalantine[/nation]) with a simple hello and your wish to enter the region.
