The suspiciously scottish crashers from [region]Lone Wolves United[/region] have come to steal your tea and bring you [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7rPOaoPL4I]freedom[/url]. Beyond this, we have also decided to set up a party tent for good measure. Additonally, we have determined that cricket is best played with defenders, but unfortunately none so far have shown up, so we sit around drinking our sto- err, newfound tea instead. Why not join us for a cup in the [url=https://discord.gg/NeK4arG]tent[/url] and our [url=https://lone-wolves-united.boards.net/]forums[/url] in the meanwhile?[hr]
