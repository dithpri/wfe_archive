Welcome to England. A resurgent community unbroken by ceaseless adversities and celebrating with pride the complexity, nuance, and greatness of the English national soul.

[i]&#147;There are some heights in Wessex, shaped as if by a kindly hand
For thinking, dreaming, dying on, and at crises when I stand,
Say, on Ingpen Beacon eastward, or on Wylls-Neck westwardly,
I seem where I was before my birth, and after death may be.&#148;[/i]
