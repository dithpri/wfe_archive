ENGLAND

A green and pleasant quiet place, where all are welcome.

The invasion recedes into the oft remembered past and the community of nations in England are thriving.

England as a region continues rebuilding with a new but rapidly learning government team at the helm, full of youthful exuberance and crackingly good looks.

England has reaffirmed its love of tea, tea and biscuits and teatime and ecourages all nations and regions to join the world community of tea lovers.

Remember....whatever happens. Do not panic.....a nice sit down and a cup of tea usually makes things look a lot better, and if a little biscuit can be had with your tea....well the world cannot be that bad can it ?
