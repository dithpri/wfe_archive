[color=darkblue]Did you ever hear the Tragedy of England the wise? I thought not. It&#39;s not a story they won&#39;t tell you. 
It&#39;s a NPA legend. England was a region, so powerful and so wise they could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to not be tagged... 
They had such a knowledge of the dark side that they could even keep the ones they cared about from being tagged. 
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. They became so powerful... 
the only thing they were afraid of was losing their power, which eventually, of course, they did. 
Unfortunately, the NPA is strong in the ways of the force and tagged them anyway 
It&#39;s ironic they could save others from being tagged, but not themselves[/color]
