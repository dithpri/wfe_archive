This royal throne of kings, this scepter&amp;#39;d isle,
This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
This other Eden, demi- Paradise;
This fortress, built by nature for herself,
Against infection and the hand of war;
This happy breed of men, this little world;
This precious stone set in a silver sea,
Which serves it in the office of a wall,
Or as a moat defensive to a house, Against the envy of less happier lands;
This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, [b]this England[/b].
