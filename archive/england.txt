Some of the most tranquil and inspiring sites in the world can be found in this &quot;Green and Pleasant Land,&quot; in this &quot;Merrie England,&quot; with its rolling countryside, village greens, and age-old pageantry.

Remember that whatever happens, do not panic. A nice sit down and a cup of tea usually makes things look a lot better, and if a little biscuit can be had with your tea, well the world cannot be that bad then, can it?
