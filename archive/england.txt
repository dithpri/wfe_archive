[b]Election Announcement[/b]

It has been a month since the events that unfolded, and I believe now is the right time to call for an election. Nominations are being called for the following positions:
- Delegate
- Vice Delegate
- Homeland Officer
- Security Officer
- Communications Officer
- Diplomacy Officer
- Research Officer

Nominations to be TG&#39;ed to Bogans and Boozers. Nominations close 11:59pm GMT on Monday, 23rd November. In the event of no nominations for a position, the incumbent stands. In the event of only one nominee, the one nominee will be declared winner unopposed.
