Welcome to England!

We are still looking for member nations to become part of the regional council - not only is it your chance to have say on how things are run here, but the opportunity to potentially prevent future raids. TG Bogans and Boozers if a role on the regional council is something you would be interested.

We also strongly encourage as many member nations to enrol into the World Assembly - the more WA nations we have endorsing the delegate, the more difficult it is for invaders to take control.
