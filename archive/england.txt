So far have 4 confirmed candidates for the delegate leadership race. There is still time to enter, but please let me know by Thursday via TG or the RMB.
We will have a week of campaigning for votes then to find out who will lead us.

We are looking to increase activity, boost our numbers and restore England to its high ranking throughout the NS community.

Holy Tyrr
