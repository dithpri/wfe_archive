[i]On the eighth of September, 2022, Buckingham Palace has announced the death of her Royal Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II. This is a sad day which will live on in history&#39;s memory, for her servitude of upwards of 70 years, the longest served of any British monarch yet. May God rest her Majesty&#39;s soul, and may King Charles live long and prosperous, for his leadership to be as great as the last.[/i]
