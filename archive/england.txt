ENGLAND

A green and pleasant quiet place, where all are welcome.

We have recently been invaded but with friends we didnt know we had we have once again regained control .

England as a region has started it&#39;s  rebuilding with a new government team at the helm, full of youthful exuberance and crackingly good looks.

Remember....whatever happens. Do not panic.....a nice sit down and a cup of tea usually makes things look a lot better.
