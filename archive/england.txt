This royal throne of kings, this scepter&amp;#39;d isle,
This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, 
This other Eden, demi- Paradise; 
This fortress, built by nature for herself 
Against infection and the hand of war; 
This happy breed of men, this little world; 
This precious stone set in a silver sea, 
Which serves it in the office of a wall, 
Or as a moat defensive to a house, 
Against the envy of less happier lands; 
This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, [b]this England.[/b]
