Welcome the The Global Union of Nations!

We are a small group (Only 15 as of now) based originally on Discord. We are a group that accepts most types of nations into our region, for example: modern-day nations, reformed empires and unions, and nations that split from other nations in revolution.

As you can tell from our description, we are a heavily roleplay based Region, with the encouragement of elaborate stories and lore produced to back up your nation&#39;s position in the union.
