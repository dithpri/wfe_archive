The vast archipelago of Bornholm is an ancient Island chain located to the east of the sunken lands of the Cape Verde. The topography of the archipelago consists of dramatic rock formations in the north, down towards pine and deciduous forests (greatly damaged by storms in the 1950s) and farmland in the middle and sandy beaches in the south.
