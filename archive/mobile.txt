Mobile is the county seat of Mobile County, Alabama. Founded in 1702 by the French as the capital of Louisiana, it has been under five different administrations, six counting the state of Alabama itself, hence its name of the City of Six Flags. Mobile is important as the only saltwater port of Alabama and as a major cultural center of the Gulf Coast region.
