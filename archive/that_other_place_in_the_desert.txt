What can you say? That other place is inhospitable barren wasteland, checkered with those that society neither wants nor needs. People die, wars are fought, all for naught. We care for none, we serve none, we obey to no demand, and we don&#39;t compromise.
Going against that other place means fighting on our homeland, trading in our cities, and living under the eternal watch of Waldo. If you are willing to accept humiliation, assault, and murder, join that other place, and you shall be rewarded by rising above anything else this world has ever known.
