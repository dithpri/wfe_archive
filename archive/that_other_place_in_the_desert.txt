Hello and welcome to [region]That Other Place In The Desert[/region]! We are a small group of neutral individuals, who are always willing to defend anyone from anything. A safe haven for those fleeing raiders, we burn with a passion for [color=#ff5555]eliminating raiding[/color] from NationStates, and the far left and right forces that drive it. Raiding is a scourge upon NationStates, and we will not rest until it is gone. 

We reserve a special hatred for The Red Fleet!
