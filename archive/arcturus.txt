[color=red]Hello! And welcome to Arcturus. A roleplay region which is following the lore of a few previous RP&#39;s between me and my friends.[/color]
It all takes place in multiverses, where many other things exist.
It&#39;s been 30 years after the devastating Vaygr War, which affected most of the multiverses, so far recovery has been going great, and the Taiidani pushed the Vaygr to the western end of their universe, capturing 70% of it and trapping the Vaygr into the &quot;Vaygr Reaches&quot;.
The Vaygr were split into multiple clans, but if they were to be united they would have the power to reclaim their universe, and spark a [B]second great war.[/B]
