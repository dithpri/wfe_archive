The European Authoritarian Collective, (EAC) is a region that intends to provide a haven for upstarting and already powerful nations with autocratic, monarchic, and/or authoritarian nations. This does mean that the region is composed of all three extremes of the north side of the political compass. In a strange attempt at a middle ground Communists, Socialists, Strasserists, National Bolsheviks, Monarchists, Fascists, and other groups all will come together to debate and dispute in power grabs for the delegate position. This region is best suited for people who want light role play/ interaction with other nations.
