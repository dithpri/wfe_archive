The only way this world is to survive is if the people give complete and utter compliance to their governments. It has been done for thousands of years. Why should it come to a screeching halt now? To stop government control is to derail the train of progress. And I, Logan Sven Brawn, have absolutely no plans to do that. But these democracies want to destroy our way of life. So I call on the countries who fight for the future, who fight for the strong, and who fight for order. Take control of your lives! And destroy those who seek to destroy yours! Starting with Voisamp, and its allies.
