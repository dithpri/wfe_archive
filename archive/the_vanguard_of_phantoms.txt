[color=purple]This region&#150;infamous on the world stage for the defense of [/color][color=#660000]fascists[/color][color=purple], was destroyed twice prior by fellow assassins of [region]the Brotherhood of Malice[/region] and allies. Within one day of its despicable reincarnation, this region was infiltrated by [/color][color=#b23aee]Assassin[/color] [nation]Falafelandia[/nation][color=purple],[/color][color=#ffcc00] the Extinguisher of Souls[/color][color=purple]. Many would have believed that the deplorable natives would have known better, but, for the good of the Overseer, they did not. The natives and ideals of the Phantom Vanguard shall be confined to this pathetic ash heap. You can hear more about our devious plans in our [url=discord.gg/brotherhoodofmalice]lair[/url].[/color]
