The Wooloo Sandlands are a region ruled over by the Empire of Puffai, a small, Corrupt Dictatorship, located towards the north-west of the region itself. The Sandlands are a large expanse of sandy, warmish areas and plains, but surprisingly lush. The landscape is also full of desert plants, such as cactuses, and prickly pears. Wooloo and Llamas roam free across these vast places, and there are many caves that crisscross below the surface. However there is no shortage of technology since the area has many bustling cities and towns, with a thriving, yet developing economy overall, and is relatively technologically advanced. They are a peaceful region who will mainly try to choose the most peaceful of ways to resolve any issues.
