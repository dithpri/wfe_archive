Welcome to the (un)Official Foley High School region. If you want to get onto our regional map, all you have to do is ask our WA Delegate,[nation=short+noflag]South Ccanda[/nation]. If you would like, you may roleplay in the RMB, but please do not expect everyone to do so. If you want a leadership position, stay active.
