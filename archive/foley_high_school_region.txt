
Welcome to the (un)Official Foley High School region. If you want to get onto our regional map, all you have to do is ask our WA Delegate [nation=short+noflag]South Ccanda[/nation]. If you would like, you may roleplay in the RMB, but please do not expect everyone to do so. When it is possible, [b]please[/b] name the leader of your nation. Lastly, if you want a leadership position, stay active. If I think you are fit for a position, I will call for an election. Thank you, and enjoy your time here in this region.
