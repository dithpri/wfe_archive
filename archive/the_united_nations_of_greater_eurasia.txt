Greetings! Welcome to The United Nations Of Greater Eurasia, a nation ran by the people for the people. Well, not quite a nation per say. No, instead we are a collection of varying states, each one its own distinct character in the grand narrative of greater society. Yes we a collection of characters from all different walks of life but here we are, united under one goal: the preservation of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all nations and their inhabitants.
