[b]ALERT[/b] Our ally [region]The Supreme Federation of New Earth[/region] is now fine, the founder came back online and banned the raiders and doing so mistakenly banned our forces in the region as well but that is all sorted out now. The region is now safe so any forces you had in the region you can now remove from the region. 

If you would like your region to join the pact contact [nation]Tanoai[/nation] or [nation]Region Tanoai[/nation]
