[b]ALERT[/b] Our ally [region]The Supreme Federation of New Earth[/region] is now safe again however this does not mean regions can let their guard down. Two different raider regions tried to take control of [region]The Supreme Federation of New Earth[/region]. As retaliation for these raids we will begin liberating other regions under black hawk control or any region that black hawk allies control.  

If you would like your region to join the pact contact [nation]Tanoai[/nation] or [nation]Region Tanoai[/nation]
