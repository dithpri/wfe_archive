[b]ALERT[/b] Our ally [region]EmbassyRegionia[/region] has been raided, they are now recovering from the raid and slowly rebuilding their region. We will give support to help rebuild their embassies if they want that support. Also as the raid is finished there is no longer a requirement to keep any defence pact nations in the region and it is recommended that you pull your regions WA nations out of of the region within the week however if you do want to leave a few WA nations there to protect in case of a second raid it is recommended that you keep them there no longer then two weeks though this decision lies with your regions leader. 


If you would like your region to join the pact contact [nation]Tanoai[/nation] or [nation]Region Tanoai[/nation]
