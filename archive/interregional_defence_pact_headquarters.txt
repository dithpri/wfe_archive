[b]Calm.[/b] Our ally [region]The Finntopian Region of DOOM[/region] has been raided by the black hawks and as such we are sending our rapid action forces there to liberate the region. They are also not members in the defence pact so you don&#39;t have to send nations to help. I still ask that member regions ready their military and to be prepared and if you do want to help [region]The Finntopian Region of DOOM[/region] then you can endorse [nation]Vul Handa[/nation] who is in the region.

If you would like your region to join the pact contact [nation]Tanoai[/nation] or [nation]Region Tanoai[/nation]
