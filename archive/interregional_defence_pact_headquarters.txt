[b]ALERT[/b] [region]The Black Hawks[/region] has raided and assisted in the raiding of a number of regions in the last few weeks. A number of allied raiding regions have assisted them such as [region]Lone Wolves United[/region] or [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region]. If a nation comes from the black hawks or an ally of the black hawks it is recommended that you question that nation and report that nation to defence pact officials. Assistance will be given to any member of associate region that needs it regarding the new raiding threat.
