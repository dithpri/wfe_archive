[b]ALERT[/b] There has been a raiding attempt on our ally [region]Union of Ever Socialist Republics[/region] luckily the founder expelled the raiders. The region responsible for the raid attempt was [region]the brotherhood of malice[/region]. I would also like to warn the regions inside our pact to keep vigilante for raiders.      

If you would like your region to join the pact contact [nation]Tanoai[/nation] or [nation]Region Tanoai[/nation]
