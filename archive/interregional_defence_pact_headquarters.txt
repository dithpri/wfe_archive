[b]Alert[/b] Two member regions have been raided these being [region]Ladanvia[/region] and [region]mater tua pinguis[/region]. Thankfully these are small operations so a full mobilization will not be needed we will instead send out our rapid action forces to liberate the regions. 

[region]the Front[/region] is our new jump point region for any defence pact operations. 

We need a new Head of Defence so if you want this position please telegram [nation]Region Tanoai[/nation].  
 
If you would like your region to join the pact contact [nation]Tanoai[/nation] or [nation]Region Tanoai[/nation]
