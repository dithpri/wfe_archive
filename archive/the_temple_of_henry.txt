A Temple built by the peoples following the theology, philosophy and wisdom of Henry Von Hoffman.

As this is a place of transcendence through meditation, we ask that nations respect our rule of silence on the Regional Message Board. Only the current embodiment of the chosen may post freely on the RMB. (Martin of Redwall)

We will share insight and you may question and have your questions answered concerning the shared insight on our off-site message boards: [url=http://w11.zetaboards.com/Temple_of_Henry/index/]Temple of Henry.[/url] You may also share your own insight there, though it will also be prone to being questioned.

Please enjoy the peaceful atmosphere of the region.
