A Temple built by the peoples following the theology, philosophy and wisdom of Henry Von Hoffman.

As this is a place of transcendence through meditation, we ask that nations respect our rule of silence on the Regional Message Board. Only the current embodiment of the chosen may post freely on the RMB. (Henry Von Hoffman)

We will share insight and you may question and have your questions answered concerning the shared insight on our off-site message boards. (coming soon) You may also share your own insight there, though it may also be prone to probe via question.

Please enjoy the peaceful atmosphere of the region.
