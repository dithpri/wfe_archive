Welcome to the Chingyist-Chongysy coalition to sail the fourty-eight seas. 

The Flag of the Coalition:
The Chingchong Coalition was made on the ideals of North Korea, really freaking insanse. This flag of ours (very, berry, beautiful) consists of a Fist enclosed in a pentagon. Each point of the pentagon represents the 5 D&amp;#39;s of Dodgeball, while the fist represents the awesome might of Xylvania.
