Welcome to the Chingyist and Chongyist coalition ever to sail the forty-nine seas. 

[color=red]The Flag of the Coalition:[/color]
The Chingchong Coalition was made on the ideals of North Korea, really freaking insanse. This flag of ours (very, berry, beautiful) consists of a Fist enclosed in a pentagon. Each point of the pentagon represents one of the 5 Ds of Dodgeball, while the fist represents the kind of punishment you will receive if you disobey regional laws.
