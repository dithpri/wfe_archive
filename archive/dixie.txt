[color=red][b]Welcome to Dixie![/b][/color]

Dixie is a friendly and peaceful region. We promote tolerance, hospitality, and freedom.

Please stop by for a visit. We&amp;#39;ll toss some steaks on the grill and open the beer cooler.

Note: We consider the display of Confederate flags to be a valid expression of Southern 
heritage and history. We do not support or accept any type of hate speech. No Nazis!
