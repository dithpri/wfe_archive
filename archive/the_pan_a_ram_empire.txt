A confederation of independent states, ruled by the central government, (with reps from each state). Ruled over by the larger, more authoritarian states, the smaller, more liberal states have some freedoms so that they don&#146;t rebel, but are not always part of the confederation by choice, and are mostly under heavy influence from their authoritarian neighbours.
