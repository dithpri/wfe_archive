[b][color=purple]The fog parts as the sun shines down, and you see land in the distance. A voice rings through your head, &quot;Welcome, to the lands of Continentia...[/color][/b]

Continentia is a region originally founded in mid-2019, and refounded September 30th, 2023. The region is founded with the intent to be a collective worldbuilding and roleplay effort. Anyone is welcome as long as they can set aside differences and be reasonable with each other. Currently, there are several such worlds in the works, being a Modern Nation RP, a Sci-Fi Nation/Organization/Persons RP, and a High Fantasy D&amp;D-esque RP.
