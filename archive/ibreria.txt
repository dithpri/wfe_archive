Ibreria is an immense fantasy world, a world of whimsicality and wonder. It is composed of seven realms, three of which are undiscovered. The four that have been discovered are;

* [nation]Haelvana[/nation], the afterlife for the virtuous.

* Ibreria, the realm of the mortal. Any nations without the names of the other realms are located here.

* Zrunix, the afterlife for the cruel.

* [nation]Flarhyxion[/nation], the elemental plane of fire.
