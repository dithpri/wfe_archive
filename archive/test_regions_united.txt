A region made specifically for testing aspects of the game that a single player can interact with, or that a player with multiple nations can interact with. Staying within the bounds of NS rules and TOS. Things such to do with the WA, large data posting, or bypassing rate limits will not be conducted by this region or the player who runs it. 

No, glitches that are found will not be posted publicly, and instead will be reported to NS staff in order to fix them. Only then will there be a possibility of posting how a glitch is done and how it affected the game. If a glitch is allowed to remain and it is given the go ahead to be publicized by NS staff then I may do so on my own time.
