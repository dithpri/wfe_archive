Hello to All, 
We are Natome Naikia. After the surrender of our great region formerly known as Tatenda, we have pledge algiance to it&#39;s legacy and decided to split from Alvaria and continue on with the one true goal of Tatenda. World order, but to achieve this we must not only give everythign to our cause but also make our region thrive and achieve great things with other Regions. This is to later help us thrive in the war against our fallen Region. May God be on our side.
Sincerely,
Natome Naikia
