Askealand is a region with new players.
You are free to join this region.
Most of us are new players.
We do not raid. We are a group of people that like to RP with our own nations.

Rules:
- We all speak English, talking in public always has to be in English.
Quoting, war cry, etc is allowed to be any type of language.

- We try to RP all of our regional interaction, if you write regional messages do it as if you where a state.

- We do not tollerate raiding. (see FAQ)

If you are experienced with nationstates and would like helping us developing the region, then tellegram one of the following nations:

- [nation]the_euro-african_commonwealth[/nation]
