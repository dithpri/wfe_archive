Freedom, a principle of the United Nations of Liberty (UNL), is the foundation of this region. The people, sons and daughters of nations, are the nation itself. This is the reason why UNL was founded. To resist tyranny, wherever it may be found, and help the people to rise. May tyrants fall to their knees at the sight of the UNL.

Nations are welcome to join, as long as they adhere to liberty. They will be protected by their brethren. As promised by the founder nation, the Democratic Republic of Darnist, no soul will be left behind.
