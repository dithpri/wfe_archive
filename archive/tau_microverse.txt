The [i]Tau Microverse[/i] is an extra-dimensional graviton immersion bubble (basically a tiny universe). It is located deep inside the subspace and thus completely isolated from the universe. 

The [i]Tau Microverse[/i] was artificially created to serve as a super-maximum security sanctuary for the [b][i]Tau Species[/i][/b]. The subspace bubble is controled by [b][i][nation=noflag]the Tau Sphere[/nation][/i][/b].
