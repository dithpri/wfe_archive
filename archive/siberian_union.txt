The Siberian Union broke away from the Soviet Union when it collapsed. It was founded by the COMi Corporation based in Commosky and is a cold desolate place perfect for those that want to be far from others or want to practice sciences that most find &amp;quot;immoral&amp;quot; as in the case of the COMi Corporation. Any country that supports the advancement of technology through any means necessary, is welcome in this territory. 

&amp;gt;Signed, 
&amp;gt;Comrade Commissar of State, Vladimir Visilli of the United Socialist States of Commosky
