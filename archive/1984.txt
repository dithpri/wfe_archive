[i]Strong and peaceful, wise and brave
Fighting the fight for the whole world to save
We the people will ceaselessly strive
To keep our great revolution alive
Unfurl the banners, look at the screen
Never before has such glory been seen

Oceania! Oceania! Oceania!
&#39;Tis for thee!
Ever deed, every thought, &#39;tis for thee.[/i]

[b]WAR IS PEACE
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH[/b]
