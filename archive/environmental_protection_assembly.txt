The Environmental Protection Assembly political region for those dedicated to raising awareness of environmental issues and taking action to preserve the environment.

We welcome nations of political alignments so long as they can show dedication to, and are willing to partake in sensible discussion on, a healthy environment without causing undue offence to other nations.

We also hope to be a fun region, it is NationStates afterall.

As a new region much is yet to be established such as an official constitution and government structure but it is hoped that these will come together as membership grows.

For now the founder maintains sole executive power in the region until a government can be established,but don&#39;t be afraid to get involved.
