Eresta: The similar world.

Eresta is a planet suprisingly much like earth. Both fauna and flora and almost identical, with homo sapiens being the only sentient being. Eresta is currently in what we would call on earth, about 2015 A.D. Most of the same inventions have been created, with many minor changes. The politics, geography, inventions, ideas, and even a few religions are very similar to our world. The history is, obviously, quite different.

Join for a RP of this world. Create a realistic nation and do political stuff. Warfare may eventually become an option. Map is not finished, but I am working on it. TG me for questions.
