Hello! Welcome to east Asia :D. We are a region centered and based around the cultural and geographical area of East Asia, however we welcome all nations, cultures and religions. Make sure to check out our rules before posting. Every month we host a regional event but the catch is that we keep it a secret until 3 days before it happens. If you&#146;re planning to join we&#146;d appreciate it :) 

Rules:

No spam
[spoiler]no posting meaningless or random things or posting stuff at a high fast rate. Doing this will get you banned[/spoiler]

No flaming or harassing other nations 
[spoiler]doing this once will not result in a ban. Doing it more then once will result in a permanent ban.[/spoiler]
