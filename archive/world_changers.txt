We are the [b]World Changers[/b]. We are an [u]sports roleplay[/u] region that seeks to remake the world of [url=http://forum.nationstates.net/viewforum.php?f=7]NS Sports[/url] in our own image and become the leading sporting region in all of NS.  Everybody is welcome in our region, from the newcomers who just signed up for their first NS Sports event to veterans of NS Sports who have been around for years.  Even though we are the newest of the sports regions, several major events have already been held in our region and we hope to bring more major events to the region in the future.
