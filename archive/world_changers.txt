We are the [b]World Changers[/b]. We are an [u]sports roleplay[/u] region that seeks to remake the world of [url=http://forum.nationstates.net/viewforum.php?f=7]NS Sports[/url] in our own image.  Everybody is welcome in our region, from the newcomers who just signed up for their first NS Sports event to veterans of NS Sports who have been around for years (and their puppets).

Embassies will be granted to any other sports roleplay regions, upon request.  Our RMB is open to everybody for NS Sports related chat.
