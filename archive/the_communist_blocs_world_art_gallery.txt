Welcome to the Proletarian World Art Gallery of The Communist Bloc.

The glorious biggest leftist NS region offers you this collection of art masterpieces coming from very different cultures, ages, personalities, styles, for every person from every nation of the NS World to get inspired, offended, educated, shocked, hypnotized. 

Simply...Art.

Enjoy your visit, that is free because culture as well as life are not commodities to make profit with.

Long Live the Revolution!
