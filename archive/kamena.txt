[color=red][b]Welcome to Kamena.[/b][/color]
[color=blue][b]We are a new region, still trying to expand.[/b][/color]

Once we have at least 5 nations, we will begin elections for WA Delegate.  These nations do not include Skick and New Redsward because they are Redsward&amp;#39;s puppets.  This message will change when we have that amount.

Are you new?  Then you should ask for a spot on our map.  Go to [nation=shortnoflag]Redsward[/nation]&amp;#39;s factbook under &amp;quot;Map of Kamena&amp;quot; and telegram him for the spot you want.
