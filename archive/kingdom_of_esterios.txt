[i]Willkommen im K&ouml;nigreich Esterios[/i][/color][hr][hr][color=#002654]Founded on March 24, 2019, the [b][region]Kingdom of Esterios[/region] (KOE)[/b] is an idyllic German-themed region with welcoming people and an active regional government. The region is officially headed by [b]His Majesty [nation]Esterioss[/nation], King of the Esteriosans[/b], although The King is a largely ceremonial position; most of the day-to-day affairs of the KOE are carried out by the democratically-elected regional Chancellor. Esterios is also bilingual, with German and English serving as our official languages. If you have any questions, feel free to contact any of the regional officers for more information![/color][hr][hr][b][color=#CE1126]F&uuml;r K&ouml;nig und Land! | For King and Country! | Vassal of and in personal union with [region]Esterioss[/region][/b][/color]
