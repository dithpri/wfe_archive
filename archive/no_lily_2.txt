[b]Some bored hawks decided that they needed to find some snacks for a big day of fun and excitement! After throwing all the triggers out the window, they proceeded to slowly and carefully steal and then lose all the snacks. We, [region]The Black Hawks[/region], have failed again. If you want some snacks, you should not join us!
