Tucked into a quite, plain area of the world, there is a small developing dominion that isn&#146;t known to the rest of the world. [b]The Armed Dominion of the Desert[/b] is surrounded by harsh mountainous lands, except from the entrance, known in the local tongue as [i]Portam Ignis[/i], The gate of fire. 

If you are going to consider pledging allegiance to [b]The Armed Dominion of the Desert[/b] then know only this, If you find another place and believe it to be better that this little section of paradise, we wouldn&#146;t blame you if you left.
