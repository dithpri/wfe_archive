[i]The Persean Imperial Authority comprises four system within the Perseus Arm. While allowing member states to govern mostly as they will the PIA maintains it&#39;s own navy and direct control of the Makhar System- it is on Makhar II that the delegates to the Imperial Conclave meet to discuss policy. At the head of the Imperial Authority is the conclave-elected Imperial Consuls, generally with a single Consul coming from each member state (as each member state represents a large faction in the Conclave.) In times of War or other emergencies the Consuls will appoint an Arbiter of the Peace, which may suspend peacetime laws and take control of the Armies and Navies of both the Imperial Authority and it&#39;s member states.[/i]
