The name Strasserism came to be applied to the form of Nazism that developed around the Strasser brothers. Although they had been involved in the creation of the National Socialist Program of 1920, both called on the party to commit to &quot;breaking the shackles of finance capital&quot;. This opposition to &quot;Jewish finance capitalism&quot;, which they contrasted to &quot;productive capitalism&quot;, was shared by Hitler himself, who borrowed it from Gottfried Feder.
