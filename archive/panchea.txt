Panchea is Earth&#39;s northernmost continent, akin to Alaska, Greenland, Iceland, Siberia, and Canadian Northern Territories. Situated almost entirely north of the Arctic Circle and surrounded by its ocean, Panchea contains the geographic North Pole. Most of the continent is covered by the Panchean ice sheet, with an average thickness of 1.9 km (1.2 mi). Known for its cold, dry, and windy climate, Panchea is mainly a polar desert. Native species of animals include mites, nematodes, penguins, seals and tardigrades. Where vegetation occurs, it is mostly in the form of lichen or moss.
