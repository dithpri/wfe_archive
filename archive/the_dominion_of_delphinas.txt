The Dominion is a collective of states that have banded together for mutual security. Together, these states have created a zone of cooperation, both in economic and military exercises. A region of prosperity, Delphinas balances freedom and security. States are urged to understand such balance, and as such, governments are to be formed in ways that most effectively balance the goals of the Dominion. Delphinas believes that all individuals should have the right to freely live lives of peace, so long as they maintain their loyalty to the laws and directives of both their respective states, and the Dominion of Delphinas as a whole.
