[color=003366][b]Mauna Loa[/b] is one of five volcanoes that form the [region]Island of Hawaii[/region] in the U.S. state of Hawai&amp;#699;i in the Pacific Ocean. The largest subaerial volcano in both mass and volume, Mauna Loa has historically been considered the largest volcano on Earth. It is an active shield volcano with relatively gentle slopes and a volume estimated at approximately 18,000 cubic miles, although its peak is about 120 feet lower than that of its neighbor, Mauna Kea. 

Mauna Loa has probably been erupting for at least 700,000 years, and may have emerged above sea level about 400,000 years ago.[/color] &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
