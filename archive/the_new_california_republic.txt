The New California Republic (NCR) is a democratic federation based in California, with holdings in Nevada, Oregon, Mexico (Baja) and along the Colorado River. The NCR emphasizes many old world values, such as democracy, liberty, and the rule of law. It also strives to restore order and progress in the wasteland, though it has faced difficulty living up to those standards.
