[color=330033]The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy some 100,000&#150;120,000 light-years in diameter, which contains 100&#150;400 billion stars. It may contain at least as many planets as well. The Solar System is located within the disk, about 27,000 light-years away from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge of one of the spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust called the Orion Arm. 

The name &#147;milky&#148; is derived from its appearance as a dim glowing band arching across the night sky in which the naked eye cannot distinguish individual stars. From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. &#151;Wikipedia[/color][hr]
