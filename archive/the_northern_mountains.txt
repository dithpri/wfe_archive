The Northern Mountains is a mountainous region naturally home to an alpine/semi-tundra climate, rocky terrain, and thousands of beautiful, serene lakes.  At the center of this region are the East Sea and the West Sea, connected by the Eiden River.  Around these waterways are forests, hills and plains.  The West Sea connects to the Onetic Ocean to the west.  The region&amp;#39;s highest point is Mt. Bauher, a volcano that has been inactive for thousands of years.  Several remnants of Germanic, Scandinavian, and West Slavic tribes live in this area.  In the east, Asian populations dominate.
