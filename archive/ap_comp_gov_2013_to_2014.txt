A loose conglomerate of nations dedicated to unification in our individuality. We are all unique in the same way. Our motto &#147;Anarchist of the world unite!&#148; has recently replaced &#147;Procrastinators Unite! Tomorrow, or maybe some other day&#148;, we actually just got around to changing it, we&#146;ve been meaning to do it for weeks.

&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t ever become a pessimist... a pessimist is correct oftener than an optimist, but an optimist has more fun, and neither can stop the march of events.&amp;quot; RAH
