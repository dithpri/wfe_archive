[b]Misanthropy is the general hatred, dislike, distrust or contempt of the human species or human nature. A misanthrope or misanthropist is someone who holds such views or feelings. The word&#39;s origin is from the Greek words &amp;#956;&amp;#8150;&amp;#963;&amp;#959;&amp;#962; and &amp;#7940;&amp;#957;&amp;#952;&amp;#961;&amp;#969;&amp;#960;&amp;#959;&amp;#962;.[/b]
