Home to orbital shipyards, lush forests and sprawling gardens.

Kuat was a planet located in the Core Worlds and one of the earliest members of the Galactic Republic. It was best known as the home of Kuat Drive Yards. These famous shipyards, used to build ships for both the Galactic Republic and later the Galactic Empire, circled the planet for thousands of kilometers. It was a terraformed planet of forests and plains. Kuat was colonized by Coruscanti settlers around 27,500 BBY, before the Galactic Republic was formed. The Human Kuati had a matriarchal society. From Kuat, they sent out colony ships of their own which by 26,000 BBY had colonized Alsakan (by the Kuat Explorer), Axum, Tepasi and Humbarine.
