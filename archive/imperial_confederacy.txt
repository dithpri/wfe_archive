I invite you to join the New Axiom Empire in a tight knit confederacy of nations, dedicated to defending and having a good time together, both in the OOC and the IC. We accept all forms of government, no matter if you choose to be oppressive or decide to be kind. We do not have any strict nor conformative policies.

I do not appoint officers, only a WA delegate with no power over anything but the WA 
We DO RP. I send out regional telegrams with links to our current RP forum.
No regional maps. 
No one has any control over anything in the region except me, it&#39;s a security measure. 
We pride ourselves in not being invaded whatsoever. 
You must read the rules list before joining, to see if this region is right for you.

Always remember Z-Day
