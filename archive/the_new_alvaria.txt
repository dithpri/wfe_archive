The New Alvaria or Eastern Alvaria

Background:
A group of nations from Alcyonerra migrated to the east, seeing that Alvaria, their second home, was plagued by defenders who did not allow the refoundation and reconstruction of the region.

Purpose:
This region is dedicated in its beginnings to the meeting point of all those nations that decide to look for a new horizon, where the sun rises so that they can see the light again and arrive at their destination prepared.
