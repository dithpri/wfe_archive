The Commune,[/colour]

that place without limits

where the creation of one&amp;#39;s own world,

from one&amp;#39;s own singularity

finds its life in the affinity of others

and seeing in one another our freedom

we devastate the order of the sacred,

that once held master above slave,

black flags raised

now and forever.[/b][/i]
