[b]A nation state is a political unit where the state and nation are congruent. It is a more precise concept than [i]&quot;country&quot;[/i], since a [i]country[/i] does not need to have a predominant ethnic group. Such a state may be comprised of a single ethnic group or multiple ethnicities sharing citizenship and are referred to as Nationals thereof. We recognize all Nations of Humanity and confer full rights to each within the framework of The Nationals region.[/b]
