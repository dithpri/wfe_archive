On 1939, when Nazi Germany and The Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact, and created this region. It has been around for many years, and in this alternative timeline, Germany never turned on the Soviets, and instead annexed Poland. Germany and The Soviet Union then formed a combined country and has been united ever since. Join us, comrade!
