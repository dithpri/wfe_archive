Formed by the free association of three nations, the Seafaring Christian Empire of Centropyge, the Constitutional Monarchy of Flammeus, and the Most Serene Republic of Harpsong, Triskelion Alliance members host a variety of governments and cultures but share a common bond of friendship.  Harpsong is a beautiful, peaceful paradise; Flammeus is an economic powerhouse; and Centropyge is a colonial maritime power; but all three share a respect for personal liberty and economic freedom.
