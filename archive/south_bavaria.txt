[color=purple]We are a republic! Being involved in government has never been easier! We allow political parties to roam South Bavaria, seeking who they may buy over! We are not a one-party state. Our regional religion is Roman Catholicism. Seated in the southern hemisphere; and a sister nation to Germany, South Bavaria is the perfect place for any traditional and/or nationalist.[/color]
