The SIOLF is a region dedicated the views such as globalism, environmental health, and comprehensive welfare systems designed to help the people that need it the most whilst having factual scientific thinking and relying on friendships with other nations and regions and not on more violent prospective.[b][color=red] Those nations with no civil and political rights are [i]not [/i]welcome.[/b][/color] You will probably feel more at home if you have left-leaning policies. With that said, feel free to join anyway. This is a (mostly) judgement-free zone.
