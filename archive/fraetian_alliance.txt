[REGION WORK IN PROGRESS]
Welcome to the Fraetian Alliance! This is a welcoming, friendly, creative, free, and super cool community,(based on the Northeastern/Mid-Atlantic United States) so make yourselves cozy!

Whether you&#39;re a new player looking for the right region, or an experienced player looking for a new home, we got your back! Do you want to be a brave soldier for the Fraetian Military? Or get voted into executive, legislative, or judicial power? Or what about propose laws, vote for your government, have free and fair trials? Maybe you could roleplay, become a diplomat, help build embassies and so much more!
