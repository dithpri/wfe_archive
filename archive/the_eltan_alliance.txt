Etria is a vast continent that is host to many different cultures and races. Thought it is large, it is isolated from the rest of Nef Vultia; the new name for what we call &#147;Earth&#148;.

Etria is a land far removed from what we see today, thought there are mountain ranges and forests these appear different to the ranges we could currently encounter in our world.

Millennia in our future, Nef Vultia is a planet wrecked by advanced warfare from ages long gone in current Etrian times. This has left deep cuts and lacerations in its landscape. As well as bred a whole new set of cultures and people to inhabit what has been left behind.

Let&#146;s step into the year 350AW and the middle of the 3rd century.
