Branson is a constitutional republic, with a president and a vice president. It was originally based in Palmetto but it fell to invading forces. Now Branson is a safe region to reside in with a regional community that extends its arms to all people of all sorts.

We align ourselves not with defenders or raiders, but regions with good character.
