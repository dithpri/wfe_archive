A harsh, dry, planet that is very notable for its unpredictable weather, rugged, few lakes, fewer rivers of water, and even fewer salt water seas. This planet has lifeforms near identical to earth, but only so in the desert, tundra, steppe, savanna, plains, mountains, canyons, and grasslands. This planet was discovered accidentally on Texicorp&#39;s expedition to find a gas giant that can be harvested for helium and hydrogen in the late 23rd century. The Texicorp crew then settled on this planet to harvest fuel and detected bodies of water drinkable by humans, and the atmosphere to be sustainable for earthly life. Ushering a golden opportunity for the then little-known company to make their own nation.
