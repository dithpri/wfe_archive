We accept anyone who accepts any ideology from communism to socialism to democracy. All ideologies have advantages and flaws, this is why we accept all ideologies because we only accept the advantages and not the flaws. The main ideology is Equalism. Equalism will be a mix of communism and democracy (these ideologies are ideologies that lots of people follow) where people can vote for certain things the government can&#39;t make a decision to but also where the government owns the property. We mixed these ideologies because democracy is good but when the government owns the property, the people can trust the government to look after the property. That is the purpose of this region. Our motto of this region will be Equalism is BEST!
