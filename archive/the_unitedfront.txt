This nations name, the United Front, is meant to symbolize unity between opposites. The United Front was a joint effort between nationalists (who where at the time seen as capitalist) and communists to reunify China. This ended up working but starting a civil war. The general idea though is something to admire. The idea is having a United Front even through conflicting interest. Though they failed in the end we seek to achieve were they did not. A United Front is something we can all strive towards.
