The original currency of Earthsea is the Monocerosian Piece of Eight. To facilitate trade between the founder and member nations, Shinkaigain and West Kaigain have adopted the Earthsea Happy Dollar and the Earthsea Dollar, which are minted at the exact specifications as the Monocerosian Piece of Eight. All three currencies are used interchangeably throughout Earthsea.
