[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] went bird watching! They had a splendid times watching the toucans and the parrots, but they couldn&#39;t find the bird they were looking for the most. Then suddenly out of the corner of their eyes they spotted them! The mystical [color=yellow]Spark PIGEON![/color] Amazed in how sparky and pigeony it was they took many pictures. Then the Spark Pigeon handed them all a can of [color=red]Dr. Hawk[/color] and said &quot;No u&quot; flying off into the distance.
