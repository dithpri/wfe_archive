Welcome friends to the Industrial Legion! We are a friendly regional community for anyone. The goal of this region is to create a friendly community of equals and to just have fun.

Also, a little message to any raider groups: Good luck getting control over the legion since WA delegate has no power. Locationstein has permanent authority until further notice.
