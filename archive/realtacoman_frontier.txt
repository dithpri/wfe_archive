[color=chartreuse][i][b]ALL HAIL THE TACO[/b][/i][/color] 
[color=gray]Welcome to the new and improved [region]RealTacoMan[/region]s Frontier!
Here we will get new recruits to improve our own ability and help those who need it
All you have to do is ignore the mass amounts of ketchup all over our bodies
We may or may not be a bunch of raiders but you didn&#39;t hear that from me
Whether you are new or returning I hope that we can all help each other!
Everyone is welcome here except for [/color][color=scarlet]FURRYS[/color]
[color=gray]Now before you ask for a vote this is a dictatorship and not a democracy
Then again I will only act on things I deem unjust and in general I don&#39;t
Sincerely your Delegate [/color][nation]RealTacoMan[/nation]
[color=gray]P.S if you raid this region I will just make a new one[/color]
