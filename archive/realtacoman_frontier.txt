         [color=blue]Are We A Group Of Raiders? [/color]        
[color=orange]What no! There&#39;s no way? Just don&#39;t mind                            
         the blood stains on our clothes okay?                
   Oh and no don&#39;t worry about the constant         
    amount of nations leaving to certain regions.      
         That being said we are not raiders!  [/color]             
[color=red]How Do I Get An Officer Position?[/color]
[color=Yellow]I give Officer positions only if the target nation
 is a WA member. Exceptions may apply for more
notable nations that have done something to
 impress me. Being a WA member is pretty much 
     a guarantee if you tell me.[/color]
