HI RAIDERS
[color=blue]We Are Your Humble Friends[/color]        
[color=orange] As long as you play nice we have no reason for a quarrel and no way to attack. However due to constraints of conventions like &#147;Geneva&#148; or something I can&#146;t use nukes. [/color]             
[color=red]How Do I Get An Officer Position?[/color]
[color=Yellow]I give Officer positions only if the target nation is a WA member. Exceptions may apply for more notable nations that have done something to impress me. Being a WA member is pretty much a guarantee if you tell me.[/color]
