The expedition, known as the German Antarctic Expedition, involved the use of aircraft and ships to explore and map the region. The German team discovered an ice-free area with mountain ranges and lakes, which they named Neuschwabenland. It was located in an area between Queen Maud Land and Coats Land, in the eastern part of Antarctica.
