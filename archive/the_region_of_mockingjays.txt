This Region is where the mockingjays sing in the wind, following those who are good, and all gather with pride within its borders. Lovely birds always gather here, the wind lifting there winds, and snakes slither among the ground, adorably loving. They snuggle up with you in the day and sleep at night, eyes glinting with satisfaction.
