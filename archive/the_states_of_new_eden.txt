Welcome to the [b]The States of New Eden[/b], a new region for anyone who believes in and proclaims the truth of God&amp;#39;s word and the gospel. We are all about pro-life, pro-America, pro-conservatism, and above all, pro-Christ! Definitely pro-Christ! Anyone who takes the Word of God seriously is welcome here. If not, we encourage you to become a born again Christian and join us! 

Our new region is small but we hope to grow it abundantly. Furthermore, we are intending to be quite diverse in our side projects to promote a sense of community. For instance, the chief of these could very well be our map making project, which is currently turning out to be a really exciting and extensive project.
