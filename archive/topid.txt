&amp;quot;THE PLAY PLACE OF [nation]TOPID[/nation]!!!!

HIM is the best band known to man!!&amp;quot; &amp;lt;-Has been in the WFE since Saturday, March 6, 2010 when the region was founded.

This region originally served as a dumping ground where puppets [nation=short]Topid[/nation] used in FRA missions throughout 2010 were dumped. In mid-2012 it was decided to revive as many puppets as could be remembered to see how many nations I can recall going through. 

The flag is a picture of me taken by my girlfriend at the time from June 2012. If this gets out of date bug me for a new pic. :P
