The Iderian Peninsula is located in the northern part of the world, bordered on 3 sides by the cold, frigid ocean.
The chief power in the region is Northern Ideria. It is the largest economy, and is known for its powerful navy, and its constitutional monarchy. 

The King (or Queen) enjoys more power than most, being able to veto laws passed by the House of Commons. The House of Lords is, similarly, able to veto the Monarch, and the Lords are similarly held in check by the supreme Court.
