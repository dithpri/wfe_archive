Scandinavia is the name given to a region in northern Europe.

During the fall of the Roman Empire, there was an abundance of gold pouring into Scandinavia, and beautiful works of art in gold have been handed down from this period. Gold was used to make scabbard mounts and bracteates. A striking example are the Gallehus horns.

This region is owned by the Kingdom of Danmarkiska.
