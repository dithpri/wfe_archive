An expansive tropical continent, at the moment. Odd conical, plastic trees dot the landscape, each as big as a man. Rarely, one will see a horse prancing around, somehow without bending their legs. The ground is green like normal grass should be, but appears to be flat, and too, made of plastic. Numerous citizens wander around, building misshapen structures out of brightly colored bricks, some of which are undulating or glowing every color in the rainbow. None of them seem in any way shape or form habitable. You&#39;ll probably have a bad time here.
