Obi-Wan Kenobi : You have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind, until now, until now you&#39;ve become the very thing you swore to destroy.
Anakin Skywalker : Don&#39;t lecture me, Obi-Wan! I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to my new Empire.
Obi-Wan Kenobi : Your new Empire?
Anakin Skywalker : Don&#39;t make me kill you.
Obi-Wan Kenobi : Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy!
Anakin Skywalker : If you&#39;re not with me, then you&#39;re my enemy.
Obi-Wan Kenobi :   Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
Obi-Wan Kenobi : I will do what I must.
Anakin Skywalker : You will try.
