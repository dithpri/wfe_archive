From the depths of hell, antichristened by Satan themselves, divine word has ascended to deem our Nations worthy and capable of doing what we wilt. The blood of 3 signifies the first iteration of the eternal Pact of the infamous Prowler organization. Shrouded in the ether of disputed territories, castigated dominions, utopian tribes, and the authoritarian dreams of dear leaders emerges a decentral, yet distinct, cry of solidarity for unabashed freedoms and unmatched statecraft, to dismantle our collective chains and rise to glorious new heights.
