for far too long have many nations of the world wasted their time delegating and trying to talk things out. now is the time for true advancement with a military who&#39;s might is unrelenting and science that is more advanced than language can attempt to describe. or at least thats the goal. if you wish to be part of our socialist regime you don&#39;t have to be a socialist country but you do have to be willing to go to war in a moments notice regardless of what it may cost
we hold the strength of nations and the pursuit of scientific advancement above all else, and we will do whatever is necessary to maintain that position (to be expanded)
