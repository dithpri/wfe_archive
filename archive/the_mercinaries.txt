[color=red][b]The FES is done here[/b][/color]
Any FES troops will be kicked from the region.

We are at: [color=green][b]Threat level Green[/b][/color]
 The FES no longer has any say in this region whatsoever. 
This is an extension of power by The Northern Barren Straight and The New Templar Order.
We are also in an alliance with Syria.
