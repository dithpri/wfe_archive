The Yukon Empire once dominated this region, but the empire that the Yukons built did not last. A piece of the Heavens crashed to Earth in a cataclysmic event known as the Fall. As darkness and winter fell upon the land, the various former subjects and colonies of the Yukons fought one another while famine and disease despoiled the land. This terrible time was known as the False Tribulation, and when the dust finally settled a new cast of players found themselves at center stage.
