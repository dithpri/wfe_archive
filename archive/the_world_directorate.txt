[b]Ladies and gentlemen, this has been a trying time for all of us. I have heard your voices, and as of this morning the World Directorate will join our former brethren in the [region=Region Of Liberty]. It has been a good run for us at least, in trying to make something old new again. Yet reunification with our old friends awaits us on the other side.

Let us look then to the future, to prosperity and to better relations.

Godspeed, everyone.
I&amp;#39;ll see you on the other side.

[i]Genesis Era[/i],
Last Custodian Of The World Directorate.
