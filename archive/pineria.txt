The region of Pineria is named after the large sea that buttresses its western coast. It was traditionally home to three nations: Kasia, Baccaar, and Septimum. Due the dominance of Septimum, the traditional hearts of Kasia and Baccaar are totally under the control of the Septimum government, but local independence movements may threaten the homogeneity of the region.
