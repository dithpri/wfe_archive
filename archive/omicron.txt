Welcome to Omicron. Named after the 15[sup]th[/sup] letter of the Greek alphabet, we now serve as a region dedicated to the amazing and complex art of mathematics.

All embassy offers will be accepted, and you may communicate here no matter your residence region. We do request that all conversation in our regional message board be related to math, though.

Currently a work in progress, please stand by...
