An island ridden with shadows! This is a mild-ish fantasy setting, where there are two main cliques: The Light-alligned nations, and the Shadow-alligned nations. Non alligned nations are known as the Dim-lit.

The former is mostly recognized to be the &quot;good&quot; clique, as the shadow creatures that roam the island are known to be agressive, and deal casualties to every nation.

P.D. The creator ([nation]Luxiania[/nation] &amp; [nation]Umbraia[/nation]) screwed up doing stuff so we had to abandon the first one ([region]Noxinsula[/region]).
