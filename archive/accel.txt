The Alliance of Capitalists, Conservatives, and Economic Libertarians (ACCEL)

ACCEL is a now defunct Alliance formed on June 29, 2005, and continued operations until January of 2008 when the Alliance disbanded. 

It was known as a successful advocate of national sovereignty and involvement in the invasion/defense game, as well as other accomplishments. 

[color=grey][i]Our purpose here is to remind and educate others about ACCEL&#39;s history. This region was not created to relaunch ACCEL. The region is maintained by [nation=short]The Gipper[/nation] of [region]The United States[/region], an old fan.
