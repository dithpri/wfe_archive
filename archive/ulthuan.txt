The Isle of Ulthuan, known alternatively as the Ten Kingdoms, is the ancestral home of the Elven race, and is currently inhabited by the High Elves. Ulthuan forms a hollow ring of land floating in the sea, surrounding an Inner Sea. This inner sea is accessible only at the Straits of Lothern, in the south of the island.
