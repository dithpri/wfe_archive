[color=gold][b]Welcome to Power of Money!!!!![/b][/color]

[color=blue][i]A region called after famous&#153; commander Colin! which isn&#39;t related to Billy Gates at all, surprisingly well let&#39;s get to the point, shall we? this is an alternate 20th century, a really alternate 20th century. I if I say so myself, it also mergers ideas and concepts from many strategy games, such as Advance Wars, Victoria 2, HOI 4 and many others, oh and yeah it is fun! I think, well aside from that we can do some chat or anything else. I guess.[/i][/color]
