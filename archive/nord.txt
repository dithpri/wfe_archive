The Kingdom of Nords is in military terms an infantry-based civilization. Based on the fearsome Vikings, and drawing influences from other Scandinavian cultures, they boast the most powerful heavy shock infantry, whose main tactic is to throw a volley of axes or javelins at their targets before charging in to melee.
