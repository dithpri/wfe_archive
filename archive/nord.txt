*Bolded for effect

That&amp;#39;s right, bow down to me! Your new lord! I mean, really. You have to post something nice about me in the RMB or face certain and imminent banjection. Chop chop!

12 hours later: Well, ahhh... 12 hours in and... Um... *cough* Well... *clears throat* That didn&amp;#39;t go as anticipated. Haha. Let&amp;#39;s all just forget about that and all get along! I&amp;#39;m removing the throne and replacing my seat with a humble chair, just to appease you peasants... I mean... ahhh... citizens. (Don&amp;#39;t hurt me!)
