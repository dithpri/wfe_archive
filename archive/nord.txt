The Kingdom of Nords is in military terms an infantry-based civilization. Based on the fearsome Vikings, and drawing influences from other Scandinavian cultures, they boast the most powerful heavy shock infantry, whose main tactic is to throw a volley of axes or javelins at their targets before charging in to melee.

Reports are coming in from major towns about one known as the &amp;quot;Dovahkiin.&amp;quot; Legend tells that he will save the region from the fearsome dragons, but in reality he&amp;#39;s just using his awesome power to pickpocket the clothes right off people&amp;#39;s backs and pick every lock in the land.
