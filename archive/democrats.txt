The region of Democrats has been around Nationstates for nearly 8 years, since 2007. We&amp;#39;re a friendly region that embraces those who call themselves Democrats and other individuals of all stripes. All are welcome, so settle in and enjoy yourself. If the message board looks a bit messy, we apologize. We&amp;#39;re currently recovering from a raid by a certain NS group who shall remain nameless.
