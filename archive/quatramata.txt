The Minister of Defense will be chosen by the Founder, and that choice goes to the WA Delegate once the Founder ceases to exist. The Minister of Defense is to actively prepare the region for an invasion.

The Minister of Intelligence is chosen by the WA Delegate, and is to recruit spies to check out our enemies, make sure they have no idea what we&amp;#39;re up to, and getting the information to the Founder and WA Delegate.

The Secretary of War is the native&amp;#39;s choice. He will actively recruit an army to be used in defense of Quatramata if necessary or he attacks other regions, that need liberation.

Recruiting is allowed, as long as you stay for at least a week, and endorse our WA Delegate for that period.
