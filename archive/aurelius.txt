[color=blue]Hello and welcome to Aurelius!! We are a loosely lore accurate Elder Scrolls roleplaying region set just a few years before the events of the Elder Scrolls Online. The glory days of the 2nd Empire under the Reman Dynasty have long since passed with it being 146 years after the death of the final Akaviri Potentate. Tamriel is nothing more than a collection of small kingdoms, bickering and fighting for power over one another. Create your own ruler, choose your starting kingdom, and take Tamriel by storm whether it be by bloody conquest or lose alliances and courtly intrigue.
