It&amp;#39;s only funny til someone gets hurt,then it&amp;#39;s freakin hilarious
You&amp;#39;re just jealous because the voices are talking to me and not you!

We go into the hardest of battles with full knowledge that we&amp;#39;ll never win.

But why do we continue to fight?

That brief moment that could provide an opportunity to change the outcome and bring a glorious victory.
