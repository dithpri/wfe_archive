Rod (to Jane): &amp;quot;Do you want to blow on my pipe while I&amp;#39;m twanging away?&amp;quot;

Jane: &amp;quot;Oh no Rod, I was blowing a lot with Roger last night. But would you like to play with my maracas?&amp;quot;

Zippy: &amp;quot;No, let&amp;#39;s just pluck away with our twangers.&amp;quot;

Bungle: &amp;quot;Yes, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what size your twanger is.&amp;quot;

Zippy: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve got a big red one.&amp;quot;

George: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve only got a tiny twanger. But it works well and I like to play with it.&amp;quot;
