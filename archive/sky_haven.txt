[b]Sky Haven[/b] is a new region, aiming to be a cozy, comfy, and casual community. A floating refuge in the sky, we aim to provide a place to relax and have fun.

NationStates can be [u]hectic[/u] from time to time, so sometimes it&#39;s nice to have a place to relax, and casually enjoy the game.
