Fight over flight! Strength over shortcoming! 

We in Hexa are committed to brute force over brains when it comes to fighting. We don&#39;t stand down, we all stand up. We work as a unit. We value to force of our army but also the power of our brain. We are devoted to surviving the apocolypse, not eliminating it... where&#39;s the fun in that? We&#39;re not crazed, we&#39;re tactile! We don&#39;t allow our shortcoming, we force our strength. 

Stand together as a unit! As a Hexa!
