[b][color=#000000]Welcome to the Dominion of Firehelm, a collective of realms stretching across the galaxy forged together in the worship of the Chaos Gods and devoted to the cause of destruction and killing. No planet is safe from the fire and slaughter brought on by our Chaos Legions, and no person is above the judgment of the Ruinous Powers. [/color][/b]
