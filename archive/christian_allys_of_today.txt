CHRISTIAN ALLYS OF TODAY or (CAT) was established in 2018 for biblical christians to join and thrive in the region. All matters are open for discussion within the regions borders no matter how controversial it may be. This region is not for the babied or spineless and will not be welcomed. It pays well to be open-minded but not tolerant of everything and it will be greatly appreciated if you stand up for your beliefs in a respectable way.
