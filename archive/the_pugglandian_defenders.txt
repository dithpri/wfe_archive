We are a group of nations dedicated to protecting the greatest of them all, Pugglandia. We embark on raids and eliminate all who stand in Pugglandias way. Hail Puggle!

Can you hear them coming? Soldiers approach over the hills, coming to burn our fields, kill our men, and rape our women. Rise children of Pugglandia! Let them fall to our guns and die as pigs in our land! The true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him, but because he loves what is behind him. Onwards!
