Hello, and welcome to the Border States!

We are a region accepting nations of all ideologies and religions.
Whether you are looking for a region to lay low and escape your previous settlement or you are looking to engage in international discussions this is the region for you to stay.

Our delegate is qualified and has been in office twice, once before and after the unfortunate raid, totalling over 500 days in office.
Both our Vice Delegate and Minister of Defence have been in previous positions and are more than qualified to help in your needs and ease your stay.

If you have any questions our telegrams are always open.

Please endorse the current WA Delegate: [nation]Boku no Pica[/nation]
