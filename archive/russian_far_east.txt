The Russian Far East is the Russian Part of Far East Asia.
 
Biodiversity is high for South Sakhalin-Kurile mixed forests of the Russian Far East. With many different species of deer, Manchurian species, fish birds, insects and plants.

There is about slightly less than one person per square kilometre living here.

So, why come here to this desolate, almost unihabitable, frozen, untamed wilderness? Because there&amp;#39;s NO ONE HERE. Imagine starting your nation from scratch, the environment untouched, political problems non-existant, no hunger, no poverty, because there&amp;#39;s NO ONE HERE. You will have the potential to make the perfect country. Military support? There is none. Politics? There is none. Problems? There is none. Because there&amp;#39;s NO ONE HERE.
