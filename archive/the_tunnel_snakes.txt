TUNNEL SNAKES RULE!
................

We havin&amp;#39; elections up in this bitch! Something about nominating countries for arbitrary titles using regional polls (not to be confused with regional poles, but those are cool too). I have appointed Waffelandia as our new WA delegate, they will oversee these elections. We are still sorting out the details, but get hype.
