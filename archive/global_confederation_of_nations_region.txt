Two Factions, divided by conflict and ideology, reunited under the same banner once again. This time, forming a true successor to the World Assembly by promoting ideals such as Liberty and Democracy, whilst being dedicated to more offensive approaches to terrorist dictatorships and slave trading nations and laying the foundations for the future of alliances in the years to come. The GCN is primarily a military alliance of alliances, formed after the reunification of two very distinct WA Successors, the United Federation and the Global Alliance.
