Thentra is a region that promotes unity within all countries. We hope that the world would be more at peace. When countries join us they will stand with a chance of running for subregion delegate. These delegates will then vote in the Thentra parliament. Every nation that joins may be big or small, but every nation can have a say. As a Democratic, pacifistic society, we do not agree with war and hope that all nations may settle differences and be at peace. We also host a delegate to the WA and want every nation to have a chance of being a delegate.

We hope that our region can bring peace to the world.
