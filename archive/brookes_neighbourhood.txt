Who lives in a house like this?
Who lives in a house like this?
In number 69 there lives a transvestite
He&#39;s a man by day
But he&#39;s a woman at night
There&#39;s a man in number 4 who swears he&#39;s Saddam Hussein
Say&#39;s he&#39;s on a chore to start
The Third World War
Oh if you find the time
Please come and stay a while
In my beautiful neighbourhood
In 110 they haven&#39;t paid the rent
So there goes the TV with the
Repo men
In 999 they make a living from crime
The house is always empty &#39;cause they&#39;re
All doing time
Oh if you find the time
Please come and stay a while
In my beautiful neighbourhood
My neighbourhood
My-my-my beautiful neighbourhood
My neighbourhood
