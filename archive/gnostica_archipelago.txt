The first inhabitants of the archipelago arrived around 333,000 years ago from the Oiwuxaqir Kingdom, either by boats across the Bismarckian Sea or via a temporary land bridge, created by an uplift in the Earth&#39;s crust. Later arrivals included the Hawaiian people.

The first New Pacifican to visit these islands was explorer Wihlem Schock. 

Anciently, a volcano erupted on Ritter Island causing a megatsunami. Almost the entire volcano fell into the ocean, leaving a small crater lake
