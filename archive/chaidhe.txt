The region of Chaidhe is composed of many different nations with various government forms, cultures, and languages. The region of Chaidhe was discovered on the 6th of June, 2016, by the nation of Cheiria. The region originally was planned to be an economical and free region but then other nations began to settle on the Chaidhean lands with their other governments, like facism, communism, and democracy. Conflict began... Will Chaidhe&#39;s conflict ever end? Can peace be reached? The answer may never be given, but the nations can try to seek the prosperity everyone wants.
