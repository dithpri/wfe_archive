A personal project region set during the late Edo Period in Japan, also known as [i]Bakumatsu[/i], literally meaning &quot;End of the Bakufu&quot;, is from where this region derives it&#39;s namesake. Particularly, my RP will follow historical events between 1860 and 1869, where upon the founding of the Republic of Ezo, a divergent alternate history path will begin to span from 1869 to 1878 and even perhaps beyond! 

Thank you for reading, I hope you all enjoy.
