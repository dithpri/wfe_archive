Once the &amp;quot;stronghold of the Tea Party&amp;quot;, this region has now been shut down by [region]North Korea[/region] and The [region]Korean Peoples Army[/region].

The Tea Party, the part of the Republican party where ignorance, greed, and &amp;quot;individualism&amp;quot; all collide in a horrible fusion of terrible politics, ignorance, and terrible economic policy that brings misery to hundreds of thousands of poor and disadvantaged people. Throw in some outright racism against migrants, some not-so-subtle racism against other minorities, and you&amp;#39;ve got yourself the perfect recipe for a down home Tea Party square dance. 

Yeeeeeeeeehaaaaawwww!!!!!
