Hello there, you are looking at the page for the Australia-Canadian region we support democracy and all forms of fascism/communism must be destroyed THOUGH a socialist market economy is fine.
ozeanreisende claims the islands of Newfoundland and any other islands within 100km from any point in Newfoundland also we have Tasmania also for mainland claims we claim labrador even though France hates us now because we claim st Pierre and Miquelon they basically don&#39;t exist in this universe which definitely won&#39;t cause any world wars heh heh right everyone...
keencuria claims Argentina, Uruguay, nova scotia and chile so that&#39;s why they (my literal alt-country that I made) are able to be in this region oh yeah and the Falkland islands &amp;#128563;
