This is a region where Law &amp;amp; Order, Education, and Defense are our main and most important interests- we do not tolerate crime of any sort, especially youth-related. We are a quiet, peaceful nation who just answers the &amp;quot;Issues&amp;quot; every day, votes on WA boards, and generally just mind our own damn business. Those who do not share our beliefs, and those who violate our code and don&amp;#39;t play by the rules... well, you&amp;#39;ll just have to find someplace else to live.
