The Delegation of Gallifrey was founded by a Doctor-Who loving nation, [nation]The Cavian State[/nation]. We are a peace-loving, welcoming region that&#39;s open to anyone, even if you know nothing about the Doctor or his adventures!

We&#39;re also a potato nation (first people to coin this term on 1/4/2017) and you may not see us on often.
Regardless of whether or not we know you personally, we will certainly let you in with open arms!
Please endorse our WA Delegate, [nation]Volitopia[/nation]!
