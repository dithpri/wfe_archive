The Delegation of Gallifrey was founded by a Doctor-Who loving nation, The Cavian State. We are a peace-loving, welcoming region that&#39;s open to anyone, even if you know nothing about the Doctor or his adventures!

We&#39;re also a potato nation (note that we are the first people to coin this term circa 2017, January 4th) and you won&#39;t see us on often.

We&#39;re all a group of friends, but even if you are not in our friend circle, feel free to ask anyone with regional authority before you join. We&#39;ll almost certainly let you in, unless you have a bad history of being an invader. (Or if you&#39;re a Fascist or Communist, for that matter. Just kidding!)
