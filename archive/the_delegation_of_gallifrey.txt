[color=#e69500]Merged into the new [region]Elparia[/region]![/color]
[color=#ff471a][i]10/13/16 - 11/1/17[/i][/color]
[b]Note from the Founder[/b]
It&#39;s been over one year now. This brave new region I founded turned into something so wonderful. I have only you all to thank for that. So I thank you. This region, however, is far from dead or forgotten. Because this region strengthened our knowledge and honed our skills. But it also strengthened one unforgettable thing- our friendships.

And besides, when you step foot in those new regions, explore those new worlds and meet those new people- Gallifrey lives on. It lives on in every single person who stepped foot in here. So thank you. 

Thank you, Gallifrey. And goodbye.
