The Delegation of Gallifrey was founded by a Doctor-Who loving nation, [nation]The Cavian State[/nation]. We are a peace-loving, welcoming region that&#39;s open to anyone, even if you know nothing about the Doctor or his adventures!

We&#39;re also a potato nation (note that we are the first people to coin this term circa 2017, January 4th) and you won&#39;t see us on often.
We&#39;re mostly a group of friends, but even if you are not in our friend circle, we&#39;ll certainly let you in with open arms!
