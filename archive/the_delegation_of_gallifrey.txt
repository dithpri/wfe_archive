The Delegation of Gallifrey was founded by a Doctor-Who loving nation, The Cavian State. We are a peace-loving, welcoming region that&#39;s open to anyone, even if you know nothing about the Doctor or his adventures!

We&#39;re also a potato nation(note that we are the first people to coin this term) and you won&#39;t see us on often.

We&#39;re all a group of friends, but even if you are not in our friend circle, feel free to ask us before you join(we&#39;ll most likely say yes unless you&#39;re Communist. Just Kidding.)
