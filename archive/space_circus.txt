Actually, here you go! Autonomous Silverberg State!

Disappointing raids on this region so far: 2
 
Perpetrators:
TBH 
Trieltics 
 
 
Sarcastic comments on raiders:

[i]~Starts brought down: -1[/i]
[b]The baby hawks used their infancy to raid regions that had a lack of infants, sadly they forgot to use the Bold Font Text Protectors and therefore died upon seeing their own description when going back home with their failure[/b]


Hopefully, the Red fleet will be next. I can&#146;t wait to embarrass them.
Honorable mentions for regions that failed to raid a region of [b]1[/b] person:
Cat lickers Lily/Switz
Tax evaders 3 guys (vomit!)

Thanks to the Autonomous state of Silverberg for helping us!
