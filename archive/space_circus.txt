Lmao weak raiders

Disappointing raids: 3

Perpetrators:
Cat toe suckers Lily (again) und their allies Tax Evaders 3 Guys 
Text Cancer TBH
Dyslexics Trieltics (Hey! It rhymes! Must be true)

Note to Lily: if you aren&#146;t fast, you aren&#146;t a raider
ALSO
Took you 3 tries on a region of 1 dude to do that. Whether you did take over or not doesn&#146;t matter, you had the equivalent of the crusades ;P

Thanks to our allies, the Autonomous State of Silverberg 
People that should raid:
Sickle Scrappers The Red Fleet
Azetec-Sacrifice-Justifiers TNP/NPA
Lily, again. Let&#146;s have a rematch

Lmao &#147;tag raids&#148;. Didn&#146;t even succeed in that
