Actually, here you go! Autonomous Silverberg State!

Disappointing raids on this region so far: 2

Perpetrators:
TBH
Trieltics 

Sarcastic comments on raiders:

[i]~Starts brought down: -1[/i]
[b]The baby hawks used their infancy to raid regions that had a lack of infants, sadly they forgot to use the Bold Font Text Protectors and therefore died upon seeing their own description when going back home with their failure[/b]

Hopefully, the Red fleet will be next. I can&#146;t wait to embarrass them.
