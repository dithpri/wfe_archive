Faith. Reason. Justice. Honor. Discipline. Order. Family. These are the principles that forged the West, and together we will make NationStates great again!

This region is for right-wing nationalists and populists. We believe that peoples of different races, religions, cultures, political systems, and ideologies can live together in peace and harmony.

Remember: no degenerates.
