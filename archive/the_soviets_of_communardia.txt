Founded on 18th of February of 2014. The Soviets of Communardia are a collection of cooperative, libertarian communes. Each soviet has no specific aim, but all loosely adhere to the principle of &amp;#39;maintaining individuality&amp;#39; and encourage the rejection of any enforced economic policies.

The region&amp;#39;s motto is &amp;#39;operam et individuum&amp;#39; which translates to &amp;#39;cooperation and individuality&amp;#39;.
