[color=green]Black storms shake the air
Dark clouds blind us
Although pain and death may await us
Duty calls us against the enemy

The most precious good
is freedom
It must be defended
With faith and courage

Raise the revolutionary flag
Which carries us ceaselessly towards triumph

To the Barricades! To the Barricades!
For the triumph of the Confederation
To the Barricades! To the Barricades!
