This takes place in 2037 when Iran, Turkey, China, and Russia create a treaty called the &amp;quot;Tiger-striped-dragon Treaty&amp;quot; where they all join forces. They soon start looking for land and power. They fight against Oceania, taking over the continent, but losing many forces. They break the Geneva and UN contract, as they end up taking over Laos, Vietnam, Combodia, and all of Korea. They know that with North America in the way, they need to act quick. While Turkey and Iran launch nuclear missiles against North America, before they could act, kinectic rods from Russia and China fire all over North America. The Post Apocalypse begins.
