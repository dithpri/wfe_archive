[Color=green]The region of [region]Ultimaverse[/region] is a region made for a peace and relaxing time to hang out with people who you get on with and to roleplay in day-to-day roleplays. The day you&#39;re reading this, is the day of the region as we are current tech. [/color] This region is not one to change, as the region will change you. Ultimaverse is unlike it&#39;s heritage, meaning more &#39;outside the box roleplaying&#39;. There is so much to do in Ultimaverse, but we can&#39;t get carried away with seriousness.
