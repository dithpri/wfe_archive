Welcome to Belvaria!

A socially progressive union of socialist states dedicated to regional developments and international affairs. Each governing Office is elected into office during Voting Season with a poll. The Minister of an Office is responsible for specific regulations and polices. Every nation is rightfully allowed to vote on polls and social events.

To learn more about the region and its function, you may ask a Office Elective or read the dispatches. If you are willing to make a change in the community, join the Council and participate in discussions for next weekly topic voting polls.
