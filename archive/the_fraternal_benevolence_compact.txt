&quot;We are the alliance that stands for freedom, truth, justice, and order. Each nation is one part of the grand fabric of this region, yet each fabric is independent of one another, having the same rights, liberties, and freedoms as any another member. We will rise in greatness, yet none of our nations will be overtaken by another one. Everyone will become a great nation under our benevolence. The benevolence of unity, freedom, and honor.&quot;
