[b]Welcome to New Commonwealth[/b]
We are an ambitious region, looking to dominate the world. We have a strong relation to British traditions. We believe that any nation can make a name for its self, if it works hard, like we do here. 

Upon joining, we request that you join the World Assembly and endorse our delegate, as doing so will increase our region&#146;s international presence, and being the imperialists we are this is important to us&amp;#128130;&amp;#8205;&amp;#9792;&amp;#65039;
