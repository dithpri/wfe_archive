[b]Welcome to New Commonwealth[/b]
We are an ambitious region, looking to dominate the world. We have strong British traditions. We believe that any nation can make a name for itself, if it&#146;s determined to like we are here. 

Upon joining, we request that you join the World Assembly and endorse our WA Delegate, as doing so will increase our region&#146;s international presence and yours.
