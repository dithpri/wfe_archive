[b]Welcome to New Commonwealth[/b]
We are an ambitious region, looking to dominate the world. We strive to have strong British traditions. We believe that any nation can make a name for its self, if it works hard, like we do here. 

Upon joining, we request that you join the World Assembly and endorse our WA Delegate, as doing so will increase our region&#146;s international presence and yours, and being the imperialists we are this is important to us. It will also generate more influence for our region, protecting it from external threats better. 

WA Votes
General Assembly: For 
Security Council: Against
