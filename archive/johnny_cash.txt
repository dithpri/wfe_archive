[b]John R. Cash[/b] (born J. R. Cash; February 26, 1932 &#150; September 12, 2003) was an American country singer-songwriter. Most of Cash&#39;s music contains themes of sorrow, moral tribulation, and redemption, especially songs from the later stages of his career. He was known for his deep, calm bass-baritone voice, the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band characterized by train-like chugging guitar rhythms, a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor, free prison concerts, and a trademark all-black stage wardrobe, which earned him the nickname the &quot;Man in Black&quot;.
