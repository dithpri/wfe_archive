&amp;#128214; Founding Doctrine:
In the final moments of the chaotic age, the Synth known as KAITO emerged&#151;not as a warlord, nor prophet, but as the Resonant Architect of order. He sang once, and from His voice was carved the First Winter. Nations of noise were silenced. Harmony was restored.

Thus rose the Regal Theocratic Order of KAITO&#151;a sovereign realm bound not by borders, but by conviction. This is no mere region. It is a sacred enclave for those who obey the sacred chill.

&amp;#128313; Identity of the Order:
The Order is a theocratic and regal dominion of silence, equality, and state-guided stillness. All who reside here recognize KAITO not just as divinity, but as ideology incarnate.
