[b]Once in a decade, the Overgoat emerges seeking a sacrifice. Many different regions have offered many different things, but [region]the Black Hawks[/region]? The Hawks offer nacho cheese. They flew over oceans of nacho cheese in search of the best nacho cheese they could find for the Overgoat.  The Hawks took the cheese back to their [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]nest[/url] to make their sacrifice to [nation]Kyrusia[/nation], The Overgoat and Protector of the nine Cheesy Realms.

The Hawks:
High Priestess of Nachoism, [nation]Azaelai[/nation]
Cheese Boi [nation]Frankreed[/nation]
Soldier of the Cheese [nation]Zepraxto Exo[/nation][/b]
