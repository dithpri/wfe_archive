What you need to know:
1. Ainslie can kick any USELESS alt accounts/joke accounts as is seen fit. Don&#39;t worry about this if your alts are half-decent and active.

3. We currently have a Eurovision-style contest going on. You should have a telegram about it, alternatively dig through the RMB and see if you can find it (I recommend the telegram option).

Respond to the polls sent out please. They make Trainbooth a better place, and give you guys the illusion of choice.
