[color=cyan]Welcome to Trainbooth![/color]

[color=orange]At our core, we&#39;re a bunch of mates who decided to start a region and see where it went. Now we have opened our region up to everyone. Here in Trainbooth, diversity is our strength. We have people who don&#39;t know politics, people who do and people who are obsessed with it. We have nations from all over the political compass. We have communist and socialists right through to regimes that resemble the Nazis.[/color]
