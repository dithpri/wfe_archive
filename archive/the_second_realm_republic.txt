In the year 1874 in an alternate history, a great nation rose far beyond others, however it fell to corruption. The region was named the Realm Republic -- it was known for its invitations of diverse groups, varying from tyrannical individuals to liberal groups. From the Realm Republic&#39;s remnants, now arises the Second Realm Republic. Once again, the republic opens its doors for other interested nations who seek refuge from other regions or ones who wish to express their ideas. Join now to make a greater republic.
