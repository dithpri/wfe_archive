Are you a corrupt dictator? I thought so. Join the [nation]Confederation of Corrupt Dictators[/nation] and meet like-minded sociopaths and others who endorse pure evil. 

Those on the World Assembly are welcome (because we all know you&#39;re there to impose the most outrage, sadistic reforms).

[b]ALSO REMEMBER TO READ THE PINNED DISPATCHES: THEY HOLD VALUABLE AND CURRENT INFORMATION[/b]
