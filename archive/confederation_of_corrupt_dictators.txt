ATTENTION ALL CONFEDERATION MEMBERS!

For a period of two months, the Confederation of Corrupt Dictators was occupied and razed by the warring faction known as [region=DEN]. 

The region, however, has been reclaimed by its founding nation: the [region=Empire of Jocospor]. 

The Confederation will now be [i]reformed[/i] to decrease the likelihood of another successful invasion. 

Condemnation of [region=DEN] will be forever encouraged. The Confederation, now reduced, will rise once more.
