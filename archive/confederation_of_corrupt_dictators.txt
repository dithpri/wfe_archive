ATTENTION ALL CONFEDERATION MEMBERS!

For a period of two months, the Confederation of Corrupt Dictators was occupied and razed by the warring faction known as [region=DEN]. The region, however, has been reclaimed by its founding nation: the [region=Empire of Jocospor]. 

The Confederation will now be [i]reformed[/i] to decrease the likelihood of another successful invasion. 

[b]ALL MEMBERS OF THE CONFEDERATION ARE REQUIRED TO ENDORSE THE [region=EMPIRE OF JOCOSPOR] FOR SECURITY REASONS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITHIN THE TIME OF THREE DAYS WILL RESULT IN PERMANENT EJECTION FROM THE CONFEDERATION.[/b]  

As a side note, the [region=Empire of Jocospor] has placed its own [color=green]PIERRICK SEIUWERD[/color] as [u]Acting Chairman of the Confederation.[/u] Seiuwerd will remain in this position until the current crisis has abated.
