&quot;I&#39;ve been very partial to Malcolm X. There&#39;s a lot of good in what he says.&quot;
&#151;Clarence Thomas, interview with [i]Reason[/i], 1987

&quot;Here are some things they don&#146;t know: Thomas is a black nationalist. In college he memorized the speeches of Malcolm X.&quot;

&quot;If Thomas begins from premises that are shared yet arrives at conclusions from which we recoil, that might argue for closer scrutiny of the steps he takes along the way... But that need not be our only response... We may ask ourselves not where he goes wrong, but where we did... The task at hand is not to retrace and rebut his moves from premise to conclusion, but to go back and start again with different premises.&quot;
