Welcome to Sepiano! 
Sepiano is a MT region in an alternate universe. Inside it inhabit the eight nations of their known world, [nation=short]Unified Thulox[/nation], [nation=short]Dardorior[/nation], [nation=short]Gonlok[/nation], [nation=short]De Madi[/nation], [nation=short]Rompsomfal[/nation], [nation=short]Pel Pashii[/nation], [nation=short]Moiya[/nation], and [nation=short]Cynwrig[/nation]. 
The nations of Thulox, Cynwrig, Moiya, and Pel Pashii are the World Forum states, united by an international organization called the World Forum. Dardorior, De Madi, and Rompsomfal are the post-UP states, the survivors of a civil war that destroyed the Unity of Peoples, an organization created to challenge the WF. Gonlok is currently a disputed state attempting to gain independence.
