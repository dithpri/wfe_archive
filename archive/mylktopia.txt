[color=#decbcb][b]We are the Mylk[/b]. The birthplace of all things wonderful and silly and weird.[/color]

[color=#bfe9ea]Founded by [nation]Mookits[/nation] &amp; [nation]Kyrocodile[/nation] to have a community, friendship based region centered on the wonders of Mylktopia. We wanted a little strange, and a little cute.. and something a little different. So here we are![/color]

[color=#decbcb]Our citizens get to participate in Mylkwars under the rule of their heads-of-houses, the Mylk Courtiers. They battle for honour, bragging rights and whatever the Celestial Mylkarchy deem fit at the time. [url=https://discord.gg/CXff9nkeWC]Join our discord for further information![/url][/color]

[color=#bfe9ea]Visitor&#39;s to the region get to view the Battleground and chat with all our mylky mates in our discord, so they don&#39;t miss out on the fun[/color]

[color=#decbcb]Don&#39;t be afraid to pop into our [b][i]yard[/i][/b] and say hello![/color]
