[color=#C19BC3][b]We are the Mylk[/b]. The birthplace of all things wonderful and silly and weird.[/color]

[color=#49B7BA]Founded by [nation]Mookits[/nation] &amp; [nation]Kyrocodile[/nation] to have a community, friendship based region centered on the wonders of Mylktopia. We wanted a little strange, and a little cute.. and something a little different. So here we are![/color]

[color=#C19BC3]The Bokks tried to contain us. The Saccs thought they could hold us down. But we showed them! We showed them all! By the might of our words and the strength of our pens, we have emerged victorious! Long live the Juggs! Long live Mylktopia![url=https://discord.gg/CXff9nkeWC]Join our discord for further information on the epic battle![/url][/color]
