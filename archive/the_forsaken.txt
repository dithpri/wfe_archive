Enji Island is a huge ever-growing Island/Continent where wars are fought and new lands are discovered, but not every Nation gets the treatment of living on Enji Island. Some attempt and those who fail are welcomed here, a nation built by rejects for rejects. And for those who don&#39;t originally hail from Enji Island, you&#39;re just as welcome as any other outcast.
