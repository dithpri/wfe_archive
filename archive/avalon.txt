[b]With Gleaming Bayonets and Perfect Formation, the Royal Kantrian Army has Captured this region! Glory to [region]Kantrias[/region]!

Special Thanks to [region]Europeia[/region] and [region]The Kingdom of Denmark[/region] for their help. Also thanks to [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region] for their support.

All Incoming WA Nations must endose [nation]Your Democracy Hating Brother[/nation] and TG said nation with their identity, or risk banjection.

You should be happy I&amp;#39;m not following my General&amp;#39;s Advice and trying to banject all of you.  We&amp;#39;ll be gone in a few days, so just keep calm and carry on. 

In the meantime, why not visit our regional forums? [URL=http://z13.invisionfree.com/Kantrias/index.php]Here[/url]
