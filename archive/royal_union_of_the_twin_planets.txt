&quot;For peace, security, and the welfare of the twin worlds.&quot;

The twin worlds, located in the alpha-phi-canis system is a pair of binary habitable worlds each bearing an empire of its own. With unrest and opposing political views an unsteady alliance has been created in order to keep the twin worlds secure from major catastrophies. While infighting might occur, the twin worlds are unified in their goal to protect their solar-system, and keep their civilisations stable and expanding.

Only time will tell if this alliance shall hold merit.
