A secluded pirate haven where outsiders are frowned upon.

Old Tortuga was Discovered, conquered, and shortly ruled by the Northeast Trading Company until liberated by pirates and disgruntled employees. The waters of Old Tortuga house a single nation: The N.E.T.C. Archipelago ( Inaptly named since the pirates have done away with any reminiscence of the company ). It is like any modern nation, besides the fact that wooden sail ships flying black flags still patrol the waters. Most of these ships are employed by the government to collect taxes rather than plundering. The citizens of the N.E.T.C. Archipelago don&#39;t see a difference.
