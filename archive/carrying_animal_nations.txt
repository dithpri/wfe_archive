Members of the &quot;Carrying Animal Nations,&quot; or C.A.T for short, believe in isolation first and foremost, but loyalty second. We will not allow you to join without extreme trust, but if you join, you will find i won&#39;t be just another region, but a family. Please, only nations populated by creatures fur, scales, feathers and everything in between. Also, Dogs must be kept on leashes, but no other discrimination. Don&#39;t forget their shock-collars!
