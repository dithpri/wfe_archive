The Kalthornian hegemony is the most glorious conglomeration of states to ever exist. 
One day, and that day is fast approaching, our might shall be unmatched! Woe be upon those who dare stand in our way.

All states of the hegemony must allow for Kalthornian merchants, traders, and corporations to do bussiness with their own. 
All states of the hegemony must prepare their armies to march whenever Kalthornia requires their aid.
All states of the hegemony must submit to superior Kalthornian authority.
All states of the hegemony must allow the Kalthornian Orthodox Church to operate within their territories.

ALL HAIL THE KAISER!
