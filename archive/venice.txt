Come, rest your weary legs for there is entertainment to be had. Enjoy our roleplay, tell us a story, discuss a game and play a few.

We do not care about the size of our region and we do not care about politics. Why play the only game that ruins friendships when you can play those that make friends?

Welcome, friend, and I hope you will join our community.
