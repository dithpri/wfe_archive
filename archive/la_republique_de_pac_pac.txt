 the revolution was 3 years to this date an the continent of south america was left in ruin, to be taken over by a force of democracy that was only to be matched by the introduction of the infantry, bringing peace and plenty to the scattered and broken, now that relative order has been restored, those left in the wake must make a choice, to be overrun by this new civilization, or to be Vanquished from barbarity by the lights of progress.
