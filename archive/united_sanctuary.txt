[color=489DCF]We are the [region]United Sanctuary[/region], the unification of nations with no goal other than to spread peace and kindness throughout the world of NationStates. Or just wear really cool shiny armor, whatever works. Led by the great and somehow elected King Alfred XIV of [nation]Jobber[/nation], we hope to lead the world into a new light.[/color] [color=BDB02A]Our nations live under the great mythical dragon at the peak of Mt. Zenith, Ultima.[/color]

[color=139037]Despite the lore I just stole and mangled from a certain card game that will not be mentioned, we are not a very serious region. Don&#39;t worry about a bunch of RP stuff, we accept anyone and everyone who just wants to have a good time! :) Our only rule is to have fun! And, uh, don&#39;t be a scumbag, but that kinda goes without saying.[/color]
