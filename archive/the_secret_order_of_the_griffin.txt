   The Secret Order of the Griffin is a region bound by honor, loyalty, and justice. Dragon and Griffin riding are our level of expertise.  The Secret Order of the Griffin has its own set of laws: respect the other members, no cursing on the group chat, and must have a respect for God, King of Kings! and Lord of Lords! He deserves our reverence!
    To the Order! &amp; To the King!
