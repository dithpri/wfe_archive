The Lebuteran League represents a collection of sovereign states aligned with mutual interest in peace and international diplomacy. We respect national sovereignty, and any policy made within a nation is not the concern of the League. We will allow some select communist nations to join our fold, but such countries will be kept under heavy scrutiny and subject to immediate expulsion should their government reach an unacceptable state. While the administrative head of the League and delegate to the World Assembly is the nation of Smos, all league members are encouraged to discuss, debate, and suggest voting patterns before the league&#39;s vote is cast. Long live the era of Lebuteran!
