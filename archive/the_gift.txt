[region]The Gift[/region] is the area in the North stretching fifty leagues south from the Wall that was given to the [url=http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Night%27s_Watch]Night&amp;#39;s Watch[/url] in perpetuity to support and aid the Watch. It is under the protection of both the Watch and Winterfell. The eastern lands of the Gift consist of large rolling plans that reach the Shivering Sea, while the western regions, which end at the Bay of Ice, are increasingly forested and mountainous.

The Watch guards these lands under [nation]Lord Mormont[/nation]. All are welcome here provided they come in peace and accept the law of the land.
