Welcome to The Grand Alliance! We are a region founded upon ideals of international peace and diplomacy. We encourage all of our members to endorse one another to take advantage of our small size and create foreign ties. We believe in democracy and encourage our nations to help each other with their issues (should they ask for it). However, due to the dangers of raiding, the leader has permanent Executive authority, though he rarely uses it and strives for democracy throughout the region.
