Penny Lane is a region of excellently styled men&amp;#39;s hair, sparklingly clean fire engines, pouring rain and blue suburban skies. 

Although inhabitants of the nations of Penny Lane are mainly peaceloving hippies and cyber-freaks, the region isn&amp;#39;t a pushover by any means and there are some real tough cookies who claim it as their homeland and will fight tooth and nail to ensure that what civil liberties they have are preserved.

Penny Lane-ites hold fast to many and various spiritual foundations, but all believe in one story of creation, in which a letter was received from the night skies proclaiming the creation of The Land. They also look to a time, foretold by the prophets, when The Founder will one day return to bring harmony to the Land.
