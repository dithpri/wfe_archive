[i]&amp;quot;Resources exist to be consumed, and consumed they will be. If not by us, then by some future generation. What right has this forgotten future generation to deny us our birthright? None, I say. Let&amp;#39;s take what&amp;#39;s ours, eat and chew our fill.&amp;quot;[/i] CEO Nwabudike Morgan, &amp;quot;The etics of greed&amp;quot;. 

We hail the big capitalists and industrialists like Ford, Rockefeller, Hearst and Hughes.

Likewise, we abhor the attacks of communists and socialists alike on the rights to own your own property. Their acts of malevolence and greed echoes throughout history.
