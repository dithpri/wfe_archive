We are Federation Lexaeus. If you wish to join contact me, I will be asking you questions. 
We mainly focus on secularism. 
We seek to create a region with its own government, independent from the WA. We will hold elections and vote on many things. 
We do not know if we will be anti WA yet. We are a Marxist region however we do have some nations that are not Socialist/Communist. 
things we focus on-
1.Secularism.
2.Socialism/Communism. 
3.Regional power.
