Welcome to the Empire of Oceania!

At one time we were [I]200 nation strong[/I]. As of this moment we are still going and talking with the few left. We are active and always welcoming other to join. Our brave Emperor, [nation]King John XI[/nation], helps lead us through the troubling times that may very well occur.  And to that, we all thank him.
