[RP only]Ominous Valley was founded by ShadowVeiled after fleeing from 2 other nations that treated the regions as one giant nation it mostly consisted of dictatorships and holy empires that where constantly at each others throats finally the citizens of ShadowVeiled voted to leave the nation to find their own which they found in an extremely and what appeared to  be man made valley where the trees where a dark black along with most of the grass being black almost as if it was charred by a great fire it was even odder that Shade Dragons ShadowVeiled&amp;#39;s national animal was absolutely every where so they decided to remain here in a foggy ominous valley which is how the nation got its name.
