        The Union of Capitalist States is a union of two nations that promotes capitalism, civil rights, and most importantly, freedom.  The UCS is anti-communist due to the founding nation ([nation]Mississippi and Louisiana[/nation]) having poor diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union at the time the union was founded.  These views have not changed, but the union is willing to negotiate with communist countries.
