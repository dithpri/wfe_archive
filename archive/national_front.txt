We are not fascists ...
Only we are national soldiers fighting for the fatherland and not the leader.
We are not communists.
Only workers and soldiers want to build their greatest homeland away from the feminist and gay left and away from the hatred and stupidity of the right.
We are a national federation between military and national states that want to build themselves without harassing idiots from the hate right or from the gay left.
