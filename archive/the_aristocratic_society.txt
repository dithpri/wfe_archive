As the name suggests, The Aristocratic Society is a group of nations led by an aristocratic elite. It requires significant skill and experience to navigate the dangerous waters of politics and court, and it is simply so much more convenient to only allow those raised in such an environment to take part in the art of statecraft. 

Also, if you have any ideas to improve our proud Society, or if you wish to contribute in some other way, we would be delighted to hear your suggestions.
