The Yorkshire Alliance is an alliance and an amalgamation of nations from many walks of life on NS. We try to run our region better than any government could and all nations are welcome to join except for Lancastrians. They are strictly forbidden. [color=red]Only WA nations are allowed to join and if they do, they&amp;#39;ll get endorsed immediately![/color]
