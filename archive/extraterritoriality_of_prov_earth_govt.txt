The Provisional Earth Government claims sovereignty and jurisdiction over all territory of the Earth; however, as we are currently a Government-in-Exile, as our territories are de facto controlled by various political entities, for the time being we maintain extraterritoriality on these as-of-yet non-demarcated and very limited possessions. All who wish to discuss the reinstatement of our legitimate government over its lawful claims are welcome, provided they announce their peaceful intentions prior by way of official state telegram. The Provisional Earth Government withholds the right to revise its policies concerning international relations and emigration.
