I AM AN EVIL DICTATOR. And I see a whole army of my fellow dictators here in defiance of freedom. You have come to fight as free men, and free men you are. What would you do without the freedom to control your nation&#39;s every move? Will you fight? Aye, fight and you may die. Run and you&#39;ll live -- at least a while. And dying in your thrones many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days of these free nations rule, for just one chance to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they&#39;ll never take our right to oppress!!!
