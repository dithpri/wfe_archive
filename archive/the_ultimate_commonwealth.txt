This region has been [colour=green]refounded[/colour] with the assistance of [region]Tranquility Sphere[/region], an embassy region of the former &amp;quot;The Ultimate Commonwealth&amp;quot; region. The reason for the refounding is that the previous founder of this region, [nation]Fahrel[/nation] had ceased to exist on 10 July 2015, rendering the region vulnerable once more.
