Welcome to the [region]Council of Nations[/region]!
We are a region that let&amp;#39;s [b]YOU[/b] do what [b]YOU[/b] want. You don&amp;#39;t need to be a WA member (though it&amp;#39;s encouraged so you can participate in elections), nor do we ask you to [i]make love to Hippos[/i], you just need to WANT to be here!
Please endorse the (future) delegate [nation]Gaelskraan[/nation], and message him with any questions you have.
Post on the Regional Message Board anything that you like unless it annoys me.
