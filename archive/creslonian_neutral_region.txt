[u]Overview[/u]

Creslonia&#39;s territorial waters and economic exclusion zone. Secured by the Creslonian National Defence Force. 

OOC: I don&#39;t want to be in any particular region, so made this in lieu of absolute regionlessness. This region (i.e. me) is completely neutral to other regions, although I am open to embassies and establishing channels of communications, just don&#39;t except my support or hindrance. 

[u]Embassy Priveledges[/u]

&#149; Any region may ask for a reason why their embassy proposal was rejected (if it is).
&#149; Any embassy-established region&#39;s officer(s) with the &#39;communications&#39; authority may post on the CNR RMB. 
&#149; Any embassy-established region&#39;s WA delegate may post on the CNR RMB or telegram me to request my vote for or against a WA resolution.
