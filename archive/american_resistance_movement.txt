[b][u][color=blue]American[/color] Resistance [color=red]Movement[/color][/u][/b]

We are the People of the United States. We are fed with our Government trampling over our Constitutionally-given rights. We have let, faceless, special interest groups take control of our currency, government, and media. They have stripped away our national sovereignty, and are letting us be taken over by faceless, international globalist agendas. [i]They[/i] erode our freedoms, attempt to disarm us, in order to look after their own hides. But NO MORE! We will fight for our [b][color=blue]Constitution[/color][/b] and [b][color=red]our Republic[/color][/b]!
