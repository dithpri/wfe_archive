[i]welcome to[/i] [b]The Frontier[/b]

[i]The Frontier[/i] is 10,000,000 acres of untouched and untamed deserts, grasslands, and forests. Come here and settle! [i]Be aware, however[/i]. There&#39;s no civilization... Which means there&#39;s no law. It&#39;s a tough world out there. Maybe someday when enough settlers arrive we may be able to form a government... If enough settlers survive. So good luck settlers! I&#39;ll see you out on the frontier.
