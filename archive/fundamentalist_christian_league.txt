This is a region of hard-core medieval theocracies. It believes in small government and environmentalism. The key to happiness is not be found in this fallen world, and so governments in this miserable region don&amp;#39;t give a toss about the physical or mental health of their enslaved populace. It is only their spiritual health that matters, and the government belief is that faith can only be forged and strengthened under the grinding heel of oppression and poverty.
