[region]Xerox[/region] is a chaotic group dedicated to both peace and war. They accept only the best, most technologically advanced nations into their inner circles. Both raiding and peacekeeping is allowed for [region]Xerox[/region] members, but all actions are chosen by the members themselves. Leading positions are not as strong as they are in other regions. It is recommended that a player checks with others of [region]Xerox[/region] before doing either, as that may be a designated war or peace target.

Xerox was founded by the nation [nation=short]Periphelion[/nation].
