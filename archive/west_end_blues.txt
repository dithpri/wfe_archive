&quot;West End Blues&quot; is a multi-strain twelve-bar blues composition by Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver. It is most commonly performed as an instrumental, although it has lyrics added by Clarence Williams.

The &quot;West End&quot; of the title refers to the westernmost point of Lake Pontchartrain in Orleans Parish, Louisiana. In its heyday, it was a thriving summer resort with live music, dance pavilions, seafood restaurants, and lake bathing.

By far the best known recording of &quot;West End Blues&quot; is the 3-minute-plus, 78 RPM recording made by Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five on June 28, 1928.
