                              In the bonds of love we meet,
                              Hear our voices, we entreat
                              God defend our free land.
                              Guard Pacific&amp;#39;s triple star,
                              From the shafts of strife and war,
                              Make her praises heard afar,
                              God defend New Zealand.
