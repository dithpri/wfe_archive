Here at the United North we are accepting to anyone who wants to join us. We are peaceful and will not seek out war but we will try to be prepared for the worse. Because we are a young region we will need patience in order to build up in size. I, myself, am fairly new to the game so I&#39;ll be figuring things out as we go. If you have any questions or concerns send me a telegram and I&#39;ll do my best to satisfy. Thank you and welcome to the United North.
