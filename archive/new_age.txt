For those who rather find their own spiritual path than the path people tell them.


1.  No Spamming, trolling, and/or flaming.
2.  Any violations are immediate banjection.
3.  No religious bashing is tolerated, nor is recruiting for New Age.
4.  We do not allow Satanists or others that worship the Christian creation known as the devil.
5.  Note, we do not condemn Christianity itself, but the off shoots that came from it.
6.  Friendly discussions about religious stuff is encouraged, but if it devolves into anything listed in rule one, the offenders will be banjected.
7.  No one can recruit for New Age, so don&amp;#39;t bother asking, any who wish to join do so because they chose to.
8.  Have fun and enjoy.
