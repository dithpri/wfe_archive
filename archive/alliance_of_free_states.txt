[region]The Alliance of Free States[/region] is a region where the nations in it are part of a Parliament which determines who can make decisions about certain issues in the region.

This entry will no doubt be updated by June 17, but probably sooner.

The countries in the region by then will work with me on drafting a Constitution and that will give more info about how this region will be run.

Ground rules:
-No WA delegate access until 10 nations join the region.
-No puppets

And most of all this region is for a good RPing environment if that&amp;#39;s what the elected nations agree upon!
