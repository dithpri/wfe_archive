It&amp;#39;s happening.
I could&amp;#39;ve saved you.
I tried to warn you but you looked away.
You asked for this.
You&amp;#39;ve made your bet.
Why didn&amp;#39;t you listen ?
You cannot stop it.
It hasn&amp;#39;t even begun.
It&amp;#39;s too late.
I told you so.
Why did you believe them ?
Don&amp;#39;t call it a grave, it&amp;#39;s the future you chose.
We&amp;#39;re trapped in the belly of this horrible machine.
And the machine is bleeding to death.
You could&amp;#39;ve prevented this.
You only had to listen.
It&amp;#39;s happening.

[b]It&amp;#39;s over.[/b]
