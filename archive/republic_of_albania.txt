[b]Enver Hoxha (1908-1985) was the leader of a truly spectacular project, the People&amp;#39;s Socialist Republic of Albania. 

Under him, railroads in the country multiplied, Socialism in One Country&amp;#39;s legacy lived on, literacy was 99% in the country and rural areas were given electricity after decades of neglect by Italian and Austrian intervention. Enver Hoxha heroically resisted both Soviet and Chinese tendencies of domination. In this regard, industrial and agricultural output was tremendous for a country of its size. [/b]
