Welcome to the Yaliski Takeover!!! We are a religiously based region that focuses on religion (suprise!!!) and military power. The more of the two you have the higher on the list you will be. NOTE: The Founder Isantri will have the most power.
If you want to see how high you&amp;#39;d be on the list do the following math: Religiousness score x 1.5 + weaponization score + arms manufacturing score = your score.
Sorry this is a little behind
Order of Power:

1. [nation]Isantri[/nation] (founder)

2.[nation]Pandora maximus[/nation] (61)

3. [nation]The Zecla Iles[/nation]

4. [nation]Lerasa[/nation] (-75)
