Welcome to The Peaceful Regime 
The sound of peace carries our message all around the world.
We protect everybody who joins us. We are a family which protects the nations within us.
The main leader of the peaceful regime will always be the founder. There will be 3 representatives who will be voted for by the other nations to represent them in front of the founder. If you think that your representative isn&#39;t representing you fairly then you should inform your leader.

Embassy Policy: Most requests for embassies will be accepted, but some will not be accepted. Usual response time for embassy requests is 4 days to 1 month.
