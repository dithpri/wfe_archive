[b]This region has been taken by [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] with the combined might of [region]The New Inquisition[/region] and [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region].

No region is safe from the imperialist juggernaut that is the UIAF. Tremble in fear as we march by! 

Nice little raid in a cool down from our personal record breaking achievements at the last major. Good job to all. Demonstrating Somerset Guard doing all the work UIAF wise here! *shocked face*

Praise the Kaiserin! Long live the Emperor!

With thanks to [region]Albion[/region], oh you guys![/b]
