     The Trans Planetary Alliance is more than just an alliance between these countries, it is also a bridge, any citizen from any of the countries in the Alliance can live or work in any other country here. Many industries are traded within our alliance, such as the fish from Blanchland, and the Undertronican baskets. Our policies make it so our alliance acts much like a country, but for as many cultural similarities, we also have our fair share of differences. But through all our differences, our common ideals shine through.
