A small region located in the northwest Atlantic founded by three leaders of three countries, the president of Eten, Sona Karel; the dictator of Viotus, Ruse Hingte and the prime minister of Otie, Rankenn Howood. When the three nations untied with a general goal, to ensure diplomacy between the three differing entities is undisturbed. While all nations are on their own separate isles, the three are always at odds, especially Viotus and Otie. Eten has always served as a land free and willing enough to act as a neutral zone, hence them hosting the Regional Congress.
