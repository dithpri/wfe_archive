The Isles of Sialgon have united, more-or-less, to form a Regional Congress. The official headquarters of the Sialgon Congress is located in the capital city of Eten. The Sialgon Conference, more or less, mostly serves as a place to settle(or, lately, amplify) diplomatic issues as well as, much less common, deal with regional issues.
