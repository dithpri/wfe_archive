Hello! Bernatamar is a young, fledging, efficient region whose inspiration was that of the co-founding nations of [nation]The Bernat Islands[/nation] and [nation]Naranamar[/nation]! [u]We hope to make peace with all[/u] and to grow into our best version of a unified region that we can be! And [b]thank you[/b] to all of the nations who have joined and may join us thus far, for you will make so much more possible for all of us as a collective; as a whole! With that said, everyone please have a wonderful and productive day and/or time here with us!!!
