[region]The Leftist Assembly[/region] banned their own comrade, [nation]The Great Slime Nation of Nick[/nation], just for asking about the Red Wedding. This cannot go unpunished. We are going to plan a coup and seize absolute authority over [region]The Leftist Assembly[/region] so that nobody has to face staff corruption ever again!

They cannot get away with this heinous crime. Revolution now! Surpree Jordan Barclay will get what he wants: complete authority over the entire Leftist Assembly. Nobody will ever be falsely banned again.

We will mold the [region]The Leftist Assembly[/region] in our image and remove the last traces of conservatism that secretly plague the region.

We are currently aiming for [b]200 WA members[/b] to overthrow the Assemblian secretary.

[b][i]The Assembly will be ours and ours alone![/i][/b]
