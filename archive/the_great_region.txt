The Great Region (best name I could come up with at the time) is a tiny region, currently home to 3 nations. This is a region with the aspiration(s) to bring positive change about within the world of NS as a whole so that not only will all nations be able to have a bright future but also that the quality of these nations can increase for the better. That, and just to chill out and have fun. We welcome nations of all kinds! No matter what ideology you are, or what region you previously belonged too, you&#39;re always welcome here! Enjoy you stay here! 

Borders: Safe &amp; Open
