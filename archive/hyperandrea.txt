Location: Extreme north of the world, &quot;beyond the north wind&quot;. The location is legendary and has been variously described by ancient geographers as in the Arctic, the Russian steppes, or on an island that some have equated with Great Britain.

Climate: Unusually temperate and sunny for its polar location, due to the favor of the god Andpollo. The sun is said to rise and set only once per year.

Terrain: A verdant land of forests and plains, producing two crops of grain per year. It is bordered by the great, earth-encircling river Oceanus and shielded from the harsh north wind by the impassable Riphean Mountains.

Capital: Andpenhagen

Gloria!
