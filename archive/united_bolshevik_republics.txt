The UBR is a region of few nations, but composed of strong beliefs. The UBR believes in the policies and fundamentals of real communism. Karl Marx, Friedrich Engles, Vladimir Lenin, and Leon Trotsky are our idols and we follow their policies. Trotskyism, and Leninism-Marxism are all believed here. We respect our fellow man, and say that nothing shall overcome our natural rights. 

We are Atheists, civil rights protectors, and completely against corporations, bourgeoisie and the &amp;quot;Free Market.&amp;quot; May we join hands with our proletarian brothers and sisters, regardless of race or sexual orientation. Let us all be individuals who are in charge of our lives! 

Long Live Lenin! Long Live Trotsky! Love Live Marx and Engels!
