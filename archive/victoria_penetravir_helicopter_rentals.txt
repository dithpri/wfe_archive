[u]This is not a Nazi region. Nazis were anti-monarchist, anti-traditional, and anti-humanity. They are a testament to the instability that occurs when the monarchy is removed.[/u]

Many years ago, Empress Victoria of House Penetravir was the ruler of a region named Angvar. A great war occured, after which Angvar fell. We&#146;ve come a long way since then, but for some reason or the other, I&#146;ve held on tot his thing for a while, albeit on and off. This region now has a new Empress. Fur Thron und Reich!
