The Continent of Kelan is a recently discovered continent that had been discovered by many in the history of the human race, But always forgotten, Today it has finally gained human inhabitants and it is a very green place with a small desert and almost no flat land. It was discovered that there was other intelligent lifeforms in Kelan around 2 weeks after its rediscovery in 1972, Such as the Khajiit Population, and the Dwarves. The Dwarves had technology similar to the story of a Fictional era called The Steampunk era, But when they were introduced to our technology they were able to make technology advance 100 years ahead.
