The recent cessation of Vavlarian activities in Vavlarian Holdings LLC has facilitated the acquisition of a majority stake in the company. This acquisition is only transitory in nature and will be liquidated after a certain period of time. During this period, the production of soft, comfortable, reasonably priced chairs will be this company&#39;s top priority. All brick chairs found on the premises will be dismantled and used for something more productive, like chair production facilities.
