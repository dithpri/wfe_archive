WE NEED MONEY. MONEY OR WE ARE DEAD, WE ARE ALL DEAD.
As a nation, we strive for the highest achievements in many seperately areas, from basket weaving to automobile manufacturing, we try to increase our economy and the strength of our great nation. Our glorious leader, Dylan Todd-Stuart, leads us with great honour, and we all dream of getting inside or Mr Campbell&#146;s wonderful rear end. Amen.
