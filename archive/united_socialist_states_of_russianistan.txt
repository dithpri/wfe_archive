&amp;quot;Freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in ancient Greek republics: Freedom for slave owners.&amp;quot; -Vladimir Lenin

This region promotes the simple ideology that the needs of the people outweigh the needs of the bourgeois &amp;quot;elite&amp;quot; and that the people should be in the forefront of the minds of its leaders. Such was the philosophy of Lenin as well as many other revolutionary thinkers in the Bolshevik era. These great minds discovered the truth that government of the bourgeois would inherently be corrupt and rule of the people is the only truly free way of life. We propose a communist government that relies on a well-regulated system of economics and a directly democratic approach to social issues.
