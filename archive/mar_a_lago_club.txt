[color=purple][b]- WELCOME TO THE MAR-A-LAGO CLUB -
THE CROWN JEWEL OF [region]DONALDTRUMPLAND [/region]
[/color]
[color=gold]The most highly guarded private club in the world. 20 ft below sea level, perfectly landscaped coral gardens in rising oceans. A landmark in the National Register of Historic Places. Members enjoy the finest amenities, the perfect setting for special events, holiday celebrations, weddings and galas.

Since purchasing this landmark in 1985, the Trump family has spent many weekends and holidays at their home away from home. When Donald J. Trump founded the club in 1995, he kept private quarters and all of the elegance that surrounds the property. A five minute drive away is the world-renowned Trump International Golf Club, West Palm Beach, a highly-acclaimed golf course.[/color][/b]
