[color=red]&#39;I need loyalty. I expect loyalty&#39;
[/color]
[color=cumcumber]The most highly guarded privates club in the world. 20 ft below sea level, perfectly landscaped coral gardens in rising oceans. A blandmark on the National Register of Historic Places. Members enjoy the finest amenities, the perfect sitting for special events, holiday delebrations, weedings and galas.

Since chasing this blandmark in 1985, the Tramp family has spent many wee bends and holidays at the home away from home. When Donald PP. Trump founded the club in 1995, he felt private quarters and all the elegance that surrounds the property. A five minute swim away is the world-renowned Trump International Golf Club, West Palm Peach, a highly-acclaimed golf course.[/color][/b]
