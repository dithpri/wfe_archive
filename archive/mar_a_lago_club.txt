[color=red]&#39;I need loyalty. I expect loyalty&#39;

[color=gold]A grotesque glittering golden jewel to entice the greedy. [region]Mar A Lago Club[/region] was constructed quickly, breaking all building codes, employing highly paid illegal immigrants working in secret on the night shift. The paper and tar walls are painted golden and cheap Chinese imported plastic products sprayed in gaudy shades and screwed into every available space. This is a crummy tasteless monstrosity, no one with any class would come here![/color]
