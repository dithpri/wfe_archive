This world is founded by three Celestial Queens, who are revered as Goddesses.  Setun, Magil and Nefa were the first of all the celestials who deigned to descend to the lower world and create the human race from the cosmic sand of Setun, the sincere tears of Magil and the maternal warmth of Nefa.  Having created people, the Three Goddesses taught them everything they needed: from carnal love to waging a bloody war.  And they founded a city on a hill called Sewrat as a shrine to their idol mothers.  Here the first state in history appeared, the great state, Orthensia.
