The results of the presidential election are as follows; after seeing heated debate on the issues of communism, segregation, and states rights, the Social Democratic Party&#39;s Brandon Colt won over the North American Republican Party&#39;s Robert E. Lee. The makeup of Parliament also reflects the outcome of this election with the SDP controlling a majority of seats while the NARP leads the opposition alongside the Human Future Party and Labour&#39;s Front.
