[b]THIS IS THE IFA WARTBURG FAN CLUB[/b]
The fan club for the most famous and best sounding pop group in the civilized world.

IFA Wartburg was created by the cultural committee of the East German government to force the young audience to like music that is politically healthy.

Therefore, IFA Wartburg only play songs that have a positive message about socialism, peace and friendship. That is a result of the fact that the music is written according to five-year plans formulated by the East German government.
