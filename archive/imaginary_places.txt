Welcome to Imaginary Places! A region for roleplayers, worldbuilders, factbook writers, and flag designers looking for a place to park nations that don&#39;t seem to fit in anywhere else. Creative collaboration and solo roleplaying both highly encouraged. Please read the rules and be aware of the 14 day grace period to meet region standards - they aren&#39;t much![hr][color=73C8A9][b]Please, introduce yourself over telegrams, I won&#39;t bite![/b][/color] - [nation]Slaggstone Bruntt[/nation]
