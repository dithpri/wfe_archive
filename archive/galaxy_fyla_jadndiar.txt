[b]Merry Christmas to you all!!

Your feathery friends were at it again! Spreading their wings while also spreading the Christmas cheer and tradition to natives far and beyond across the multiverse as they searched for Christmas decorations! Present also were some friendly Sand people legionnaires from the Sekhmet Legion who helps build us a star from Silicon!

Do you want to help decorate the TBH Christmas tree as well?, Hurry up and  [url=https://discord.gg/cbfahneg]JOIN US![/url] before Christmas morning arrives!!.
