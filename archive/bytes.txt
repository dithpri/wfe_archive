A computing-themed card farm run by [nation]Guaylandia[/nation]/[nation]The Cosmic Mainframe[/nation], for the benefit of myself and others.

All regional officers and those listed in the About Bytes factbook are me; however, a few puppets in here belong to other users, such as [nation]Smiley Bob[/nation]. Feel free to bring your puppets here as well.

Want a card from one of my nations? Telegram [nation]The Cosmic Mainframe[/nation] (the nations in this region have TGs blocked). Apart from some that are needed for collections, I will accept reasonable offers on most cards.

I accept most embassies, so request them at will.
