[b][color=#a60000]The flag flies high! The ranks tightly closed!
The Storm Battalions march with calm, firm step
Comrades shot by the International and Antifascists,
March in spirit within our ranks.
Already our Leader&amp;#39;s banners fly over all streets

[region]NAZI EMPIRE[/region] RISES!

Clear the streets for the Storm Battalions!
Millions are looking upon the banner full of hope,
The day of freedom and of bread dawns!
The last sound to charge is blown!
For the fight, we all stand prepared![/color][hr]CAPITAL OF THE [region]NAZI EMPIRE[/region][/b]
