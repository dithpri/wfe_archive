The Vormanian Commonwealth of Federative States (V.C.F.S) more commonly known as the Vormanian Commonwealth, is a semi-political and economical union of nations. All members of the V.C.F.S have a semi-independent government, and in most cases it&amp;#39;s own sovereign/head of state however the Supreme Leader of Vormania takes that role. All nations will use the Vormark as their currency and the Star of Vormania will be added to the current flag. No matters that affect the whole reasons will be dealt with without a meeting with the leaders of all nations.
