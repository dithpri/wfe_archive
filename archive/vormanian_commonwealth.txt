The Vormanian Commonwealth of Federative States (V.C.F.S) more commonly known as the Vormanian Commonwealth, is a semi-political and economical union of nations. All members of the V.C.F.S have a semi-independent government, and in most cases it&amp;#39;s own sovereign/head of state however the Supreme Leader of Vormania takes that role. No matters that affect the whole reasons will be dealt with without a meeting with the leaders of all nations.
