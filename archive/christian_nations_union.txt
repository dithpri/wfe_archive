[b]Hello![/b]This is a Christian Defense Organization, where the [b]Conservative Christianity[/b]  is preserved. We served and manage our nations according to the principle of [b]Bible[/b] and for [b]God[/b] alone. We will strive to preserve the [b]Conservative Christianity [/b]for the Mission of our [b]Lord Jesus the Christ [/b] .

A little reminder: while we are conservative (American) and anti-Communism, we don&#39;t like the behavior of judging the people according to their appearances. However, we will distinguish things according to the principle and standard of the Lord. We welcome religion and cultural conservative. No Communists and No Nazis! 

Cold-War is far from over. 1991 is just the start of the end.
