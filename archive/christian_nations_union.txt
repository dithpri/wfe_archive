[b]Hello![/b]
This is a Christian Region, where the [b]Conservative Christianity[/b]  is preserved. We served and manage our nations according to the principle of [b]Bible[/b] and for [b]God[/b] alone. We will strive to preserve the [b]Conservative Christianity [/b]for the Mission of our [b]Lord Jesus the Christ [/b] .

[b]Given the so-called &#39;Equality&#39; Act is about to pass, and given that the fact that our National Sovereignty will be heavily intruded, the Christian Nations Union has decided that none of the member states should join WA in the future until the repeal of the Act![/b]
