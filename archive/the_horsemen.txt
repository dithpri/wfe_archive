When the end times are upon us. When F7 is swarmed by FFT space empires and doubleposters. When all hope of a reasonable debate is lost. 

They come. 

Heralded by great calamity, and dragging far greater ruin behind themselves, they embody the universal, omnipresent fear inherent in man since his earliest inception.

There is no stopping them. They will not show remorse or pity.

All one can really do is pray, and hope against hope that they will not be found.

For hope is sweetest just before it is snuffed completely.
