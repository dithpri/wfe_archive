Little is known about [region]TerraNova[/region]. Many speculate it&amp;#39;s peoples to be a cultist regime but these assertions are often made by rulers and governments that consider [region]TerraNova[/region] a threat to their ideals, if not their power. Other reports indicate that [region]TerraNova[/region] is a, so far successful, attempt at Utopian society; rumours circulate the the leaders there are responsible and benevolent, valuing the education, training and freedom of their citizenry above all else. These claims, however, are as unsubstantiated and speculative as those of their opposition. At any rate, until the Terrans make some sort of contact with the outside world, aside from the occasional WA vote, they will remain a constant controversy.
