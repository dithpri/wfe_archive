Our Founder:

The Empire of PremireUS is a huge, safe nation, notable for its zero percent divorce rate and complete absence of social welfare. The hard-working, democratic, devout population of 260 million ENGLISHUSians are highly moralistic and fiercely conservative, in the sense that they tend to believe most things should be outlawed. People who have good jobs and work quietly at them are lauded; others are viewed with suspicion.
