The Far Land Islands is an archipelago in the middle of the Nowheretobefound Ocean and is highly unknown for the moment. There are plenty of island sizes and climates on them, from tropical to tundra. In order to place your nation here, please notify the government of Almenia, in Titanium Island, to join in. We hope you enjoy the lands!
