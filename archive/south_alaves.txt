South Al&aacute;ves

Welcome to Al&aacute;ves Valley, where bureaucracy is as calm as our rolling hills and the most heated debates are about who gets the best picnic spot. Here, political maneuvering is limited to deciding who will host the annual &quot;Best Pie Contest.&quot; Relax, kick back, and enjoy a place where the only thing getting a workout is our community spirit!
