Set in a semi-arid Mediterranean landscape, The Luscious Lands Of Lyreniah are home to many natural wonders, such as flowing streams of pink and night skies full of aur&amp;#333;rae. The nations of Lyreniah live peacefully among nature, although some do tend to expand.

Lyreniah was originally colonized by the people of 1st Epitome United, and their plans of Cultural Revivalism have reached this region. While everything is settling into place, nature is holding its breath, wondering what could possibly be in store for their wildlife.
