Our liberal region is a political philosophy or worldview founded on ideas of liberty and equality. Whereas classical liberalism emphasizes the role of liberty, social liberalism stresses the importance of equality. We liberals espouse a wide array of views depending on our nations understanding of these principles, but generally they and the government support ideas and programs such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, free markets, civil rights, democratic societies, secular governments, and international cooperation. Because we value individuality and self-worth, all people are equally important. We believe in as few restrictions to society as possible, so the only true rule here is to simply act civilized.
