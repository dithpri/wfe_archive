[b]In the pathologization of our pleasures, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] found the pleasure to be had in pathology! In being outlawed for who we are, we&#146;ve discovered that we are indeed outlaws! Many blame raiders for the destruction of communites&#151;we take pride in this. Some believe that we intend to shred-to-bits any positive project and it&#146;s moral fabric&#151;they couldn&#146;t be more accurate. We&#146;re often described as depraved, decadent and revolting&#151;but oh, they ain&#146;t seen nothing yet. [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]Come Join Us![/url]
