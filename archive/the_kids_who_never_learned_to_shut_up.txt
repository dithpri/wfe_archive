This is a region for those nations who support unfettered freedom of speech.

If you believe that anyone should have the right to say whatever the hell they want, then this is the place for you.

This region will never have an off-site forum board. The reason for this is that by forcing people to post everything publicly on the RMB, it will encourage activity within the region and attract people to it whilst also making people open to multiple lines of attack at once, rather than only a few loyal forum users having an oligarchy on what can and can&amp;#39;t be said. It also makes people less scared of something being used against them as it would take a lot of scrolling to find anything once this region gets busy.
