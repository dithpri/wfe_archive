Locked away from the chaos of the world, you find yourself in the [b][color=blue]beautiful paradise of 230[/color][/b]. Sucks to be you! 230 is locked away from the chaos and [color=maroon]locked you out as well[/color]. 230 does not wish to make any contact with your inferior form.

A paradise exclusive to 230. Not for the &quot;[color=red]elitists[/color]&quot; of NationStates. Take that, mods; you can&#39;t reject me in my own region. Now 230 can grow into the largest, most powerful nation in all of NationStates. You will laugh now, but one day, you will bow to me. Anyways, enjoy your freedom, [color=red]future subject[/color] :)
