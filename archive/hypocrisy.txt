I am here merely to cause an outrage and point out the following.
on this site anti-fascism has become exactly what fascism represents shown by these actions:

-bigotry and discrimination, hating on someone based on their beliefs and calling your own superior to them.
-inciting hatred. by spreading messages inciting the raiding of regions and also dehumanization to this group.
-expansionism and genocide by removing the original population of regions.

be a better nation by atleast acknowledging these points and to revert to centrism.
I decided to label this region &quot;fascist&quot; because &quot;fascism&quot; is a underrepresented and opressed minority, expelled from hundreds of regions and persecuted in a thousand more.
