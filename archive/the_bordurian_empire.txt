[b]The Bordurian Empire[/b], first founded in 2013, is a historical imperialist region that was once the headquarters of [nation]Borduriaa[/nation]&#39;s territorial holdings prior to moving to [region]Elite Region of Global Command[/region]. Borduriaa has since retired (or at least this persona) from the game in 2017, and his empire fell shortly afterwards into obscurity. The old flag depicts Borduriaa&#39;s monarchist phase before his descent into the far right.

The region is currently maintained by the Imperial Custodian [nation]New Szohod[/nation].
