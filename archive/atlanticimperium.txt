Welcome to the [region=AtlanticImperium] !

Our former government structure featured an emperor and a single Head General that ruled the region. We are starting the new year right, creating new democratic positions to replace old totalitarian ones.
Our new structure will feature a head of state, Ministers of Defense, Education and other crucial departments of strong governments. A former nation has established the first map of our region, and any nation
that stays in the imperium for 14 days will be given the opportunity to pick their place. More information will be posted, including a link to our new forum under development and construction.
