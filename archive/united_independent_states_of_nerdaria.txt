Secretly, nerds rule the world. We are just making sure it stays that way. DEATH TO ALL JOCKS!! Or not, i guess.  I mean, who else is going to clean our toilets after their football dreams are crushed after they learn that although they are good, there will always be someone better.  If there isn&#39;t, some tragic ingury will cripple them before the turn 30.  Sometimes they will get lucky, and get crippled physicaly insead of mentaly. But not often.
