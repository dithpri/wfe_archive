The planet of Gaia is a massive world filled with life and magic, ruled over by the 3 Powers, beings who have ascended to a state beyond godhood. These beings each rule over massive empires and constantly compete with each other for more power and prestige among gods and mortals. Yet there are many other nations in Gaia, each with their own interests and desires who have no allegiance to the 3 powers. Gaia itself is a massive planet with several massive continents as well as several sub-worlds and dimensions linked directly to it. These dimensions often have their own nations, but trade between these dimensions is actually quite common as each dimension has access to several rare recourses impossible to find anywhere else.
