These Ideals have formed the basis of our Charter and Constitution and define the very foundations of the Alliance. since all humans are equal before death and as of such we will not discriminate on personal bias. Though acting against the peace of the allies will incure some form of punishment. We welcome all forms of nations within the Coalition and will seek to ensure the growth of all of our member-states to the best of our ability,
