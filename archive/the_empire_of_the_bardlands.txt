This Region is the hub of the global empire known as the Empire of the Bardlands. The founder of this region (and leader of the protectorates found here) is the Armed Republic of the Bardlands. This particular region only includes my Imperial provinces or protectorates, so if you want to join my real &amp;quot;public&amp;quot; region, then head over to the group the Central-East Asian Badlands.
