Did You Know?:

The Kowloon Walled City, originally a Chinese fortress not ceded to the British in the Convention of 1898, may have been the most densely populated place in human history. In a survey conducted in 1987, the population density was estimated to be an astounding 1,255,000 inhabitants per square kilometre. The Walled City was demolished in 1993 in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration.
