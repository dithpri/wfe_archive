Did You Know?:

[b]The Octopus card[/b] is a rechargeable, contactless, stored value smart card used for making electronic payments in Hong Kong. Launched in September 1997 to collect fares for Hong Kong&amp;#39;s mass transit system, the Octopus was the second contactless smart card system in the world and has since grown to be used for all public transport in Hong Kong. Octopus cards can also used for payment in most retail shops and many restaurants in Hong Kong, and are far more ubiquitous than credit cards.
