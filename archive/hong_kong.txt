[b]Welcome to Hong Kong, the World&amp;#39;s Finest City State&#153;![/b]

Did You Know?:

Hong Kongers consume a total of 900 million glasses/cups of milk tea a year. Hong Kong-style milk tea is made with black tea and evaporated or condensed milk, and is the unofficial &amp;quot;national drink&amp;quot; of the region. Next time you find yourself in Hong Kong, skip high tea at The Peninsula and instead treat yourself to a glass of [i]naai cha[/i] at a local [i]cha chaan teng[/i] such as Tsui Wah or the Mido Cafe!
