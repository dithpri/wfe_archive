[b]Triads[/b] are Chinese criminal organizations similar to the Italian mafia or the Japanese yakuza. Having roots in secret societies formed to combat the foreign Qing dynasty that ruled China from 1644&#150;1912, the triads of the present day date back only to chaos of the early 20th century. The largest triads (such as the Sun Yee On, 14K, and Wo Shing Wo) are international organizations with tens of thousands of members. In Hong Kong they are primarily opposed by the Hong Kong Police Force&amp;#39;s Organised Crime and Triad Bureau.
