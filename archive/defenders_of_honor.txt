.:.FOR THE PROLETARIAT.:.
[color=communistred]The proletariat has taken control, today, on January 10, 2014 at 11:42 CT![/color]
[color=gold] The people have taken down the headquarters of &amp;quot;Honor&amp;quot; and replaced them with &amp;quot;Liberty&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Freedom&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Justice&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Common Wealth&amp;quot;! Long may these virtues stand high above the people, &amp;quot;Honor&amp;quot;, this word killed thousands as the Lords and Kings ran under it, the rich, the aristocrats, the high classes of the world who are doomed to be stomped on by the shoes of the poor, the pheasants, surfs and the TRUE rich, the TRUE kings!
LONG LIVE THE WORKERS OF THE WORLD![/color]
This region was taken by the liberation forces of UCR.
