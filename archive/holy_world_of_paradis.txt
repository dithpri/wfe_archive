[b][color=lime]Happy Shamrock Shake month!![/color]

Today, some birds from [region]The Black Hawks[/region] took their newest members out on their first flying lessons! The baby birds did a great job, so they got to be rewarded with some delicious mint-flavored ice cream product from their local fast food chain. (Well, is it reaaaaaally mint flavored? Or does your brain just make you think that because it&#146;s green &amp;#129300;. The world may never know&#133;)
