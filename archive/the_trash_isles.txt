The Trash Isles is a region of floating islands covered in heaps of waste and pollution. Governed by an anarchic, self-sufficient society, its inhabitants live off recycling and repurposing refuse. Amid structures made of scrap metal and volcanoes of trash constantly erupting, the region reflects resistance, creativity, and chaos, where nothing is wasted and everything is transformed.
