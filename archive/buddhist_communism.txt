[i][color=red]&quot;This world is blind! There are so few Who see things as they truly are. 
Come, take a good look at this world, Pretty like a king&#39;s chariot. 
Though fools become immersed in it, For the wise there&#39;s no attachment. 
See how much it&#39;s like a bubble! See how much it&#39;s like a mirage!&quot;
~ Dhammapada, Lokavagga: &quot;The World&quot;[/color][/i]

[color=red]This is deathless, the liberation of the mind through lack of clinging.

Blowing out the fires of greed, hatred, and delusion.[/color]
