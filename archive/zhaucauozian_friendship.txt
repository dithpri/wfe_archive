[b]Delegate:[/b] WA nations, please endorse our Delegate [b][nation=shorttitle]Three Weasels[/nation][/b], or they&amp;#39;ll confiscate your cheese. =^_^=

[i]The delegate is unpredictable; will only endorse &amp;quot;worthy&amp;quot; proposals. Legend has it that bribery involving certain goods can yield positive results.  

All incoming WA solicitations from the new system are blocked. General Assembly delegates, to get the ambassador&amp;#39;s attention, a direct telegram is best.[/i]
