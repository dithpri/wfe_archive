Hello and greetings from The New Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The NUSSR, was founded fifteen years after the fall of the old USSR. One of the nations that was part of the old USSR, Erodonia, founded this union amidst massive negative feedback from the international community. The People&#39;s Republic of Erodonia created this new union under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin&#39;s great grandson, Alexei Khrushchev Lenin. Since 2004, the NUSSR has reigned with an iron fist over the fatherland and its surrounding nations.

Will you join now and be apart of the newest resurgence of the Old Empire?
