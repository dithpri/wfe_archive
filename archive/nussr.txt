The New Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ,(NUSSR), was founded fifteen years after the fall of the old USSR. One of the nations that was part of the old USSR, Erodonia, founded this union amidst massive negative feedback from the international community. The People&#39;s Republic of Erodonia created this new union so that any nation that shares in its own ideological views may come and be at peace from the dangerous democratic revolutions that are sweeping the world.
