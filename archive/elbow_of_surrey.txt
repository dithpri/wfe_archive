We are the elbow of Surrey. Our lives are continued torment.

A nation of loosely aligned states, our only common denominator being our equal distaste for Surrey. Though the spectrum of governing styles that we occupy is broad and open, we nonetheless find equal footing in our opposition to middle England.

The principles we uphold include freedom of choice (for those in power), and the fact that some of our members may or may not be literally Hitler (no names mentioned).

Entry is open to all, as long as the applicant state agrees to maintain a laissez-faire attitude to certain power-hungry despots.
