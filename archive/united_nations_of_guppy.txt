[b]The United Nations of Guppy[/b]
Here, we are all united, underneath the razor-sharp claws of our lord and savior, Guppy.

Guppy created the universe when he accidentally ate communism.

Back in Guppy&amp;#39;s day, you were intelligent.

Guppy clawed Chuck Norris in the balls and Chuck Norris was happy he was blessed by the lord.

Never bring a Guppy to a gun fight.
