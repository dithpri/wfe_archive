[b]This region is a colony of [region]Liberty Democratic Alliance[/region]. The Black Hawks have finally been repelled.

It was the previous region of [region]Liberty Democratic Alliance[/region], but was founderless and therefore unsecure. 
[region]The Black Hawks[/region] failed to raid it over in an humiliating defeat, but they finally did it in a second raid. They needed [u]2 trials[/u] to raid a founderless region! Can we say they are successful? Not so sure.

Today, we take this region back, alongside with our allies from different regions and get this new colony.[/b]
