 [b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] were sitting around a table playing cards when it struck us: Did we leave the oven on?
We popped our head inside the region and it looked like things were a mess. After sweeping up the floor, mopping some goo off the RMB, and doing a couple loads of wash on the regional flag, things started looking back in order.

So we went back to playing cards

And this time, we locked the door.[/b]
