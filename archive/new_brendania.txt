After the Doom of Brendania, most of Brendania&amp;#39;s inhabitants were destroyed.

A select few surviving Brendans were selected for a last minute project by Chancellor Brendatine to rebuild Brendania. After Brendania fell, the remaining Brendans were able reform the Brendan State of Great Brendan on a severed but intact island that used to be part of the Brendania landmass.
