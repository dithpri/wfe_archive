[i][color=#a60000]Just as the Fundamental Principles of the National Socialist Movement are based on the folk idea, folk ideas are National Socialist.

A human community is well organized only when it facilitates to the highest possible degree individual creative forces and utilizes their work for the benefit of the community.

Prejudices and egotistic interests join together in forming a common front against the new idea and in trying by every means to prevent its triumph, because it is disagreeable to them or threatens their existence.[/i][/color] Adolf Hitler[hr][/b]
