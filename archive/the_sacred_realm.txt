[color=red][b]DIN[/b][/color] created the barren land;
[color=blue][b]NAYRU[/b][/color] created the laws of that land; and
[color=green][b]FARORE[/b][/color] created life that would uphold that law.
After their work was completed, they left the earth.
When they left, they left behind a sacred golden light.
This light, known as the [color=yellow][b]TRIFORCE[/b][/color] would grant the deepest desires of those whom wish upon it.

This is the land that guards the [color=yellow][b]TRIFORCE[/b][/color].  This is [color=purple][b]THE SECRED REALM[/b][/color].
