[i]Welcome to the Wayfarer&#39;s Library - a comfortable place tucked away in a remote corner of the known world, loosened from the normal laws of space and time. Inside, you will find a vast expanse of arcane, eldritch, and wondrous knowledge, the likes of which even the most seasoned traveler cannot help but be awestruck by.

Beings and individuals of all kinds are welcome in the library... as long as they can survive it.[/i]
