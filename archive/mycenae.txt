Following the two devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th century, a number of far-sighted Mycenaean leaders in the late 1940s sought a response to the overwhelming desire for peace and reconciliation on the region. In 1951, the Hallandian Foreign Minister Efanatica GALLERION proposed pooling the production of coal and steel in Mycenae and setting up an organization for that purpose that would bring Halland and the republic of Regnohony together and would be open to other countries as well. The following year, the Mycenaean Coal and Steel Community (MCSC) was set up when three members - Fjordia, Halland, and Regnohony - signed the Treaty of Halmstad.
