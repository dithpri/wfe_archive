Taking place in 2024 during an alternate timeline, the Holy Roman Empire has survived to the 21st Century. Since being founded in 800 A.D by Charlemagne, it has thrived. Having been the nation to defeat Napoleon on July 17th, 1807, taking Paris after blowing through Napoleon&#39;s &quot;Grand Armee&quot; at the battle of Attigny, Francis II led the German army into Paris, taking the city after only 14 hours. Afterwards, the Holy Roman Empire stayed mostly neutral, involving itself little in global politics.
