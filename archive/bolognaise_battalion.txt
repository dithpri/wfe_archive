We love all types of pasta! We are a friendly collection of countries who are just here to have fun so feel free to have a look around. 

As a casual and fun region, [b]we do not tolerate acts of bullying towards other member nations[/b].

[i]As your WA Delegate, Sheniana would love your support, so if you haven&#39;t already please do join the World Association and then [b]endorse[/b] us by tapping on our country profile and scrolling to the bottom. Please also endorse our Regional Officers![/i] (If you need help with this I suggest you read this: [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=499113]Endorsement[/url])

As your WA Delegate, I&#39;m trying to increase total endorsements so make sure to join the WA and endorse everyone else!
