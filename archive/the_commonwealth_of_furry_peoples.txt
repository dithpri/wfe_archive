The commonwealth is a loose grouping of furry, scaly, feathery, mystical, mechanical, etc sovereign people, who may have little in common. There is no real central philosophy or creed. All welcome, what ever your political philosophy, creed, or people.
 
Note: Except spammers and recruiters, who are less than welcome.
