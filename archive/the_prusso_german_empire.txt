The Prusso-German Empire is a collection of states under the rule of the Empire of Prusso-Germany. Under the Empire&amp;#39;s rule, states will gain some of the Empire&amp;#39;s land, money, and will gain access to the full force of the Prusso-German Military to defend themselves from foreign foes. If a state chooses to add the Prusso-German flag to their flag or changes their flag to something similar to the Prusso-German flag, they will be rewarded, but this is optional.
