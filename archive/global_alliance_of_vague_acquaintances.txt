The Global Alliance of Vague Acquaintances was formed with the intent of holding up 5 sacred principles:

1. [b]Pineapple DOES go on Pizza, but only with ham.

2. Socks before or after trousers, but NEVER socks before pants.

3. Yes Sir, I CAN Boogie.

4. Maggie IS, in fact, in the mud

5. The Big Bang Theory is CHRONICALLY unfunny. [/b]

Failure to uphold these sacred truths will result in the offending nations immediate expulsion/catapulting into space.

Member nations will also be expected to fight (and possibly die) for our right to party.
