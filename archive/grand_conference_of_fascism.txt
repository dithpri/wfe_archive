All fascist nations in this region hereby agree to mutual respect of the territory and practices of one another under the doctrine of National Identity.  No Communist, global Socialist, Capitalist, Democratic, or Liberal governments are tolerated.  Monarchies are welcome provided the monarchy is acting for the benefit of its nation and people.  Our goal is the expansion of our states and the spread of Fascism.  Ask [nation]Fascism In America[/nation] if you want to join.

We do not undertake military actions, but our ally [region]The MT Navy[/region] does, so join them as well if you want to spread our ideology that way.
