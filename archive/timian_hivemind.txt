I want to create a region for Timiania to spread the ideas of freedom and republicanism. I want to make a place to foster sister republics under the guidance of Timiania. My republic and, therefore, my region are against totalitarianism of any kind. Now, I am admittedly semi-authoritarian, though I would never oppress my people and steal their rights. We are a nationalist, conservative country governed by the laws of God, and so we are devoutly anti-socialist. We are also a protestant so if you are Catholic or Orthodox realize that.
