Greetings Wanderer, welcome to our humble abode. You have strayed far from your original course. We only open our doors to those who seek rest, rest from worldly endeavours and peacefully let the days go by.

If you do not seek rest, I suggest you set forth and regain your bearings. But if you do, you need only to answer a question and the mist would part revealing the path, welcoming you in it&#39;s embrace.
