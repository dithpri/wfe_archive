[color=#00BFFF]And now a poem for your reading pleasure.


A golden ring, hammered into strips of shining metal,
Fills the chest in the mead hall and furnishes the ale,
We&#39;ll toast a victory tonight, to the breaking of a region,
And the resounding kisses of our dear ones left behind.[/color]
