The Denois Sea Conference(DSC) is a open yet affluent administration centered as a haven for 
all nations wishing to be exempt from joke and alter-earth nation regions.
 The mission of this region is to create a region full of complex cultures and governments that allows free &amp;amp; open discussion between such nations. 
 Joke and alternate earth history nations will not be accepted in.
 Although you are not required it is highly appreciated that you have a overview of your nation as a fact book. 
 
Join us now for a ever lasting Union of Peace and Friendship.
