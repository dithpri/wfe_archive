Welcome! This is a region conceived for the libertarian minded - the belief that liberty is the primary virtue of humanity and that the State should be minimized to the greatest possible extent. Here, one will rub shoulders with market minarchists and market anarchists of all varieties. 

Anyone who believes in individual free will is welcome. Here you&amp;#39;ll find the cure for [i]state[/i]holm syndrome.

[i]Liberty is not a means to a political end. It is itself the highest political end.[/i]

[i]The ideal Government of all reflective men, from Aristotle onward, is one which lets the individual alone &#150; one which barely escapes being no government at all.[/i]
 - H.L. Mencken
