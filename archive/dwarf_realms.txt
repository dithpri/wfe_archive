The Dwarf Realms are a testament to the dwarves&#39; unwavering spirits. Here, dwarves are encouraged to pursue their passions and talents, whether it be mining, blacksmithing, engineering, or the arts. The region is teeming with bustling Holds, where dwarves hone their skills and create masterpieces that are renowned throughout the realm.
Dwarves embrace a rich variety of traditions, and customs. From their love for hearty feasts and grand celebrations to their fondness for storytelling and epic sagas, the dwarves of the Dwarf Realms are deeply rooted in their cultural heritage.
All are accepted within the Dwarf Realms borders, even non-Dwarves. All will have a place at the Hold-ting. And a select few as the High Kings advisors.
