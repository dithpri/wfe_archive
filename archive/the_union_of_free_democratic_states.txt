The Union of Free Democratic States (UFDS) is a geopolitical entity created to unite the nations of the world which are truly democratic in their politics. The union was created in the midst of the Cold War as a neutral movement of democratic/capitalist states which refused to join either side. The union remains intact to this day and welcomes all nations who conform to its high standards of political, economic, and personal freedoms.
