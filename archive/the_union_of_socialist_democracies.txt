Hello, we are the Union of Socialist Democracies.. We are a Union of Socialist Countries and States that have united under one banner for a better chance to protect ourselves against foreign powers.

We trade many important supplies and we share military strategies, doctrines, soldiers, and equipment.

We have a duty to protect our allies and neighbors if they may be invaded or influenced by a foreign military or diplomatic power.

Any country may join as they have a given right to be protected.

We are a union of Socialist Democracies that help eachother and protect each other.
