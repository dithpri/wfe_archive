[color=green]Welcome to the Commonwealth of Trees, a friendly, pacifist, and environmentalist region promoting friendliness and regional culture![/color]

[i][color=maroon]The Commonwealth is a new region, so we&#39;re still actively researching nations willing to take part in a future regional government or just help us create an awesome, verdant community. Join us today and have a role![/color][/i]

[color=blue]We&#39;re interested in all aspects of democracy and free speech. Once we&#39;ve got a stable population, we&#39;ll institute a regional government and have regular elections. All citizens are encouraged to submit dispatches, art, and ideas to improve the Commonwealth![/color]
