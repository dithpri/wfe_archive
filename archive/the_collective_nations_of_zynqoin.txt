The Collective Nations Of Zynqoin (also known as The Collective) is a region of the world that is focused on making everyone feel welcome, as well as supporting the individual as opposed to lumping everyone together as a whole. To grant rights, but not take them away is our mission. If something is considered &#39;wrong&#39;, we ask why. If there is not a valid reason to consider something &#39;wrong&#39;, then we will do everything in our power to make sure it is considered &#39;alright&#39;. By joining this region, you must vow to protect the rights of every individual and take down corrupt leaders, as well as the systems that kept them in power. For that is our mission.
