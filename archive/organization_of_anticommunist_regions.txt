Organization of Anticommunist Regions was created by forces from Libertatem and The Federal Islands as an anti-communist front.

This agenda was compromised in 2012 when this region was refounded by the Regional Defense Committee.

Refounded again on 21 December 2013 by The Red Vanguard in retaliation for the refounding of The Soviet by Right Wing Uprising and in honor of all revolutionary regions that have been attacked by reactionary forces.[/color][hr]
