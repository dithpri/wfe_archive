The Seven Deserts is a large expanse populated by many religious and political pilgrims. Relatively seperated from the rest of the world, you can see many different ways of life, some more, er, vile than others. Poverty and gross luxury live side by side, and large cities seperated by a parched landscape are dotted around the region. The region is tense with vaguely defined borders and unsavory non-governmental groups on the outskirts of society.
