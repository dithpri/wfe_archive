LIStopia, created by Estina Filipoa. She was a robotics-major who emerged from Kroh, an industrious society. Filipoa was a genius engineering robotics and nanotechnology that revolutionized the modern cosmetic industry. Such inventions brought her fame and fortune and political power as the president of a corporatocracy,which famously combined the Arms Manufacturing and the Cosmetics industry to create a shocking megacorporation. LIStopia raises enough revenue that allows Filipoa to waste astronomical amounts of currency on pointless business ventures such as glow-in-the-dark cars, and phonetic-toilets that can read the newspaper for the user. Filipoa represents the affairs of LIStopia in the hallowed halls of the World Assembly.
