[b] The United Collective, a group of nations on the remnants of Earth in the year 5027, after Earth being hit by a meteor that nearly decimated the Human Race in 2070, Humanity nearly took 3,000 Years to replenish itself and return to it&amp;#39;s old civilized ways. Now, Earth is broken and shattered but the people still live, chasing after their own goals to survive. [/b]
