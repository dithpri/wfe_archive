The Island Round Up is a region ruled over by the Kingdom of Biato a small, Corrupt Dictatorship, located towards the north-west of the region itself. The Sandlands are a large expanse of sandy, warmish areas and plains, but surprisingly lush. The landscape is also full of desert plants, such as mango trees. Toucans and Parrots roam free across these vast places, and there are many ancient caves that zigzag below the sandy beaches.  The region has few bustling cities and towns, hidden deep in the jungle, yet high in population. The countries in The Island Round Up tend to find ways of solving issues that will make everyone happy.
