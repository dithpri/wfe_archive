The Union of Consiliun Islands came about after a thawing in relations between the four major powers in the Consiliun Isles. The Treaty of Union 2012 established the region to bring the Islands closer together, but also provide them with more confidence when becoming involved in international affairs. Instead of all acting independently, the Islands can now take a united stance on foreign events. The original members include, from largest to smallest, The Provisional Republic of Consilius, The Grand Duchy of Mirian, The Holy Empire of Tolstoy and the Free Land of Presence.
