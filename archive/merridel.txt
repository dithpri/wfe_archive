[color=red] Merridel was once a great region they said, rise like a phoenix they said, smoother like a coal it did. Now victim to [region]The Brothers of Auralia[/region] its last breath has been squeezed out. While we burn your books and destroy your towns, remember this. Defenders may save you but they cannot bring your region back to it&#146;s former glory, or back from the dead. [/color]
