[i][color=teal]Bound by the sharp edges of [region]the Square[/region] a flat world hangs suspended in the infinite void. Here, the &quot;Cloud of Unknowing&quot; veils a geometric wilderness of untapped riches and ancient ruins. Across tiled tundras and crystalline seas, empires rise in a relentless march for dominion, carving legacies into the very soil. There is no mercy in this perfect arena; one must explore the fog, expand the borders, exploit the land, and exterminate all rivals to claim the throne. In this realm of absolute conquest, only the ultimate architect of war shall stand atop the Great Monument as master of the world.[/i][/color]
