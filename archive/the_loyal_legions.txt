[b][color=orange][region]The Loyal Legions[/region] was founded by [nation]Ireran[/nation] with the purpose of creating a place where everyone could co-exist, including Democratic, Communist, Fascist, Monarchist and many more! In [region]The Loyal Legions[/region], ideology does not exist. Everyone is considered to be brothers and sisters. Nothing can separate us. We [i][u]WILL[/u][/i] defend each other and keep the fight as far from home as possible. I hope that you enjoy your stay with us and as always, be safe![/color][/b]
