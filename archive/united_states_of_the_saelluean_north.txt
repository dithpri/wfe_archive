The USTSN is a coalition of the many nations within the Saelluean North.

Even though the nations residing within the USTSN may come to blows with each other, they all have come to an agreement that ideologies such as Communism must, and will not, be allowed within the north.

The main nations within the USTSN are:

[nation]North Hells Saellue[/nation], the father of the rest.
[nation]Saelluean Natives[/nation], the overseer of the USTSN.
[nation]The Saelluean Embassy[/nation], the diplomatic centre for the USTSN.
[nation]The Vaknir Brigade[/nation], the spec-ops of the USTSN, regarded as fascist.
[nation]The Free People Of Saellue[/nation], a terrorist nation within the USTSN, mostly wiped out.
