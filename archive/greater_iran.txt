[b]This region is based on Greater Iran, also called the Iranosphere or the Persosphere, which is a wide socio-cultural region comprising parts of West Asia, the Caucasus, Central Asia, South Asia, and East Asia (specifically the Tarim Basin)&#151;all of which have been affected, to some degree, by the Iranian peoples and the Iranian languages. 
In this region, we put our ethnic group before everything. We oppose globalism, cosmopolitism, miscgenation, immigration and things that harm the Persic/Iranic identity. So, we only allow Iranic countries to enter here.[/b]
