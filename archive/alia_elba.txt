The World was in flames. Nation turned on nations, no one was free from the world detonation (who set it of no one knows). Luckley a few managed to escape, where they remained orbiting the earth, waiting. And after 156 years, the planet was deemed safe to return to. Slowly one by one nations are formed, grouped by religion, language, anything. All believing that this time, it will be better. No more war, famine or pain. Will it? It&amp;#39;s up to you.
