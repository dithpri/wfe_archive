&quot;Middle-earth&quot;, or Endor in Quenya (Ennor in Sindarin) - and in The Book of Lost Tales the Great Lands - are the names used for the habitable parts of Arda after the final ruin of Beleriand, east across the Belegaer from Aman. This continent was north of the Hither Lands shown in the Ambarkanta, and west of the East Sea; and throughout the First and Second Ages it underwent dramatic geographical changes, caused by Iluvatar. The term &quot;Middle-earth&quot; was not invented by Tolkien. Rather, it comes from Middle English middel-erde, itself a folk-etymology for the Old English word middangeard (geard not meaning Earth, but rather enclosure or place, thus yard, with the Old Norse word mi&eth;gar&eth;r being a cognate).
