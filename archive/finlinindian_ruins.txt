Long Ago Finlinind was a prospering country at a colossal population of over one billion people was put to end by a dual nuclear strike from Yesmanland and Of the Tyrannical Frogs, though some select areas were left unscathed. Wars have broken out as of late over who can lay claim to the great wasteland. Many contenders have swept through including the crusaders of The Holy Sha Alliance (Composed of Yesmanland, Belmen and The Holy Sha), the roving warbands of Of the Tyrannical Frogs and the scattered raiders of Old Finlinind. Even yet, there are some few who still wish to restore peace and unity to Finlinind, despite knowing of the atrocities many are willing to inflict to attain power.
