The Region was first inhabited by frogs and the bloons monkeys, who would build up their own civilisations. Later humans arrived, and Varl settled up north. The original inhabitants are all socialist, except the few monkeys that turned to capitalism upon meeting Titanistan. Today, it is the Cyborg Quincy that leads the region.
