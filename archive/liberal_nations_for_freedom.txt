The Liberal Nations For Freedom, otherwise known as LNFF, is a region located in the Northeast part of the world. The LNFF was created for liberal nations to band together and fight against oppressive dictatorships and any nations that deny basic freedoms and human rights to their citizens. Members of the LNFF do not declare war on such corrupt nations unless citizens are being slaughtered by the government, the nations are hostile to a member of the LNFF or they pose a possible risk to peace across the globe. The LNFF also heavily supports a free market amongst members.
