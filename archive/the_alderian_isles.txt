 The Alderian Isles is a mix of several biome types sitting on a world known as Alderia. The history of the world mostly relates back to the breakdown of the Alderian Empire, which separated into many of the modern states today, over 200 years ago during the dawning of semi-modern tech. The era is currently modern, as a plethora of nations litter the landscapes of this world, as new capitalist and communist countries dawn over world power.
