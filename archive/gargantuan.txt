A vast conspiracy has been uncovered and the traitors have been brought to justice, but at a cost. The treacherous nations have contacted TITO and may attempt to strike back and invade the region. I ask everyone to please endorse me and let me stop them from taking over our home region. We cannot allow treason and I followed the law in my actions as can be vouched for by the new Inquisitor General Klacik, the treason ran deep and we will have to reorganize everything. For now the people in power will remain the same but have different positions in this turbulent time.
