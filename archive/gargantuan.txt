[b]Message of the day[/b] 
 [region]Gargantuan[/region] is doing very well, we have re-established an embassy with one of our new key allies. Relations are growing well, and we welcome there ambassdor! Soon the Council will convene to choose the leaders within it. These were fair elections, and I uphold the Constitution. After these elections a non-partisan post will be created to make sure we have free and fair elections. The appointment will not be able to be replaced during election time.
