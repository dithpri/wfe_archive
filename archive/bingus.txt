[b]*Unidan music plays in the background*[/b]

My fellow citizens of [b]Bingus[/b],
These recent years have not been kind to our region due to the events of the atomic and zombie apocalypse. Many of of our brethren have perished and our citizens have been living in anarchy. Foreign powers have decided to make a move on our region and attempted to seize control of the remaining power structures. Due to the request for action of Omashala, the warlords of Tierra Unida have united to form the United Unidan Front. The Armed Forces of [b]Omashala[/b] and [b]Tierra Unida[/b] have managed to eject the invaders for the time being, but we must remain vigilant. 

Viva Bingus!
