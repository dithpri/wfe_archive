So many of you may have noticed that our region has a strange setup when it comes to positions of power. In our region we have the founder/WA Delegate to oversee the whole region and to decide the majority of the decisions for the region and chose the keys. Who are the keys you ask well there are four keys to power each holding a varying degree of power. This is so the keys are required to cooperate with each other and the rest of the region.
