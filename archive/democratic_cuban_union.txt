I would also like to address the recent news of the war, we have made a peace treaty and are no longer at conflict. But due to lack of growth and power I have negotiated the terms of the integration of the Democratic Cuban Union into The Atlantic Socialist Alliance. I understand many of you may be angry as this was a decision behind closed doors with the so called enemy no less. Well first off, they are not our enemy whatever happened in the past is the past and I feel like this was the best possible outcome for the region.
