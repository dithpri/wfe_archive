The Democratic States of the United Republic is a region born out of the ashes of the Terran Command. When the Terran empire collapsed the remaining nations scattered in all directions seeking safety from the outside world. Then from the ashes of a fallen empire the nation of Demermin founded the Democratic States of the United Republic or the DSUR. It is the Democratic States of the United Republic&#39;s goal to create a region and world where all hold equal power. Any and all are welcomed under the DSUR banner.
