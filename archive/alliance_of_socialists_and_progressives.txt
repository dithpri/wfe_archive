[b]Welcome![/b]

This is a region for [color=#FFBF00]progressives[/color], [color=#FF0000]socialists of the democratic variety[/color], and [color=#04B404]green-lefties[/color]!

Our three core values and beliefs are these:
[i]1. Freedom and equality should be for all, irrespective of race, gender, sexuality, religion or background.
2. Authoritarianism is under no circumstances acceptable nor should it be tolerated.
3. Democracy is precious and democratic principles should never be violated.[/i]

Entry requirements: Civil rights and political freedoms have to be no less than average for both. Other than that, none!

Stop by and ask questions on the RMB, and let&amp;#39;s get this region kickstarted!
