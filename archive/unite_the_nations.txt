we would like to unite all the nations and have some peace.

that wont happen anytime soon but maybe in a couple weeks it will

we have countries of all types from anarchy to dictatorship we have it all we have have very cool stuff too like boring papers

the last war we had was about 2 min ago that&#39;s not THAT bad there worse things but that&#39;s not the point

DOWN WITH THE DICTATORSHIPS all of the leaders are corrupt (i&#39;m not saying capitalism is not corrupt but thats off topic)

together we can end dictatorships once and for all!!!
