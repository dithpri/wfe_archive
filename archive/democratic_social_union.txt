The Democratic Social Union (DSU) is a transnational organization of nations seeking greater security, stability and prosperity. The DSU is for nations who believe that only through mutualism and cooperation can these things be obtained. The DSU is committed to basic principles of human rights and political freedoms. Member nations usually fall under the categories of liberalism or social democracy; however, we are open to all ideologies as long as they respect the principles previously outlined. 

We are anti-fascist, anti-dictatorial, anti-cooperatocracy and anti-abuse.  Welcome to the Democratic Social Union!

We are also seeking greater participation in the World Assembly!
