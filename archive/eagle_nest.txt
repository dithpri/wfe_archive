[B][color=black][region]Eagle Nest[/region] is where a new life awaits all believing the world needs care by true man, the bearer of high culture and creativity, who would manage its development, and bring civilization to its soil instead of only cruel and endless war, and destruction, yet also believes we must fight to restore our Earth through blood, sweat and fire before we can rebuild it together. 

We that wear the uniform and flag of our Commander swear complete loyalty to him and our armed forces, and dedicate our lives to service and our mission.[/color][/b]
