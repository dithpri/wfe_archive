Segmentum Solar is the region immediately surrounding Holy Terra, the holy capital of the old imperium. The factions inhabiting the region protect it at all costs, although bribes are always welcome.

Although the region is controlled by the iron first of the immortal god emperor, the identity of the emperor is disputed, with 734 registered &amp;#39;Emperors&amp;#39;, leading to some confusion among the populace.
