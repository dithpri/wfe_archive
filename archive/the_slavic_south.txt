Welcome to the Slavic South, a region inspired by Slavic traditions, historical instututions and way of life.

True to to its Slavic roots, the region is built up on the values of equality and democracy, with all member nations having a say in how it shall be run and how its laws shall be made. The same nations, however, have a duty to respect one another, aid and defend them in need and refrain from interfering with their peace,

With the Slavs being famous for their hospitality, the region shall forever keep its gates open to Non-Slavic nations wishing to call the Slavic South home, and hold them as brothers.
