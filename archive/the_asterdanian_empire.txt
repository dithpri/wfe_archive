The Asterdanian Empire, ruled by [nation]Asterdan[/nation], is the current expansion of the Asterdan. Those under Asterdanian Rule shall keep their independence on three conditions:

1. The currency must be changed to the gold.
2. They allow our military into their borders.
3. They follow our Imperial Laws, which will be different than our Asterdanian Laws.
