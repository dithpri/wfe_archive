The Sapphire Seas are a small set of oceans in-between the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. It contains creatures that were commonly thought to be extinct like the Pterygotus, the Helicoprion, the Nothronychus, and others. 

The headland is the Borderlands of Reatheyshire, who leaves no issue unnoticed and treats its civilians like a mother treats her child. It is at the Second Sapphire Sea.

When there are more nations that join this region, Reatheyshire will create artificial extensions of the islands, and may create new islands altogether. We hope that this region grows and prospers.
