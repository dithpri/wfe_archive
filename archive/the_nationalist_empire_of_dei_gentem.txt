This is a region for those who wish to be a protectorate of the mighty state of Dei Gentem, and swear allegiance to its Fuhrer. The flag represents the five countries making up the empire of Dei Gentem. The blue represents independance and freedom, the red represents the blood of mighty, brave soldiers, and the black stands for strength and honor. If you wish to join then message Dei Gentem and ask.
