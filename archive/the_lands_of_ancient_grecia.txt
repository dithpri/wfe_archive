The Lands of Ancient Grecia are traditional in their practices and beliefs, mainly including polytheistic deities. Many countries here subscribe to an Ancient Greek polytheistic religion (Natio-Grecianism), which include gods such as Zeus, Hades, Athena, and others. 

While many other regions/nations believe in gods like these, Natio-Grecianism has many different details, all dynamic and tailored according to technological and social advances. Despite the slightly-traditional religions among such countries, countries of all political and religious views are welcome.
