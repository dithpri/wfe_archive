Laetus Modo is a region set in scenario where the world was struck by a deadlier plague than the Black Death and effectively killed off 99% of the Earth&#39;s population in 30 AD. It is now the year 1950 AD, and nations are now forming after the feudal societies and city states have stopped warring with each other. What you make of your nation is completely up to you.
