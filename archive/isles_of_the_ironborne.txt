Just to get a glimpse beyond the illusion
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I&#39;m dreamin&#39;, I can hear them say[/color]

[color=red]Carry on my wayward son
For there&#39;ll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don&#39;t you cry no more[/color]
