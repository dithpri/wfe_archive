Feel free to post on the regional message board. 

This a role playing region. We can create scenarios and see how things play out as we figure out where it takes us. 

Our main goal is to work against The region called The Black Riders.

All opinions are respected when proposing a strategy.

Aterad, Homonia, Vadmire, Salvai, and Mithran, are my puppets. They are nations under my control, created by me. 

It is a good idea to have puppets if you want to take control of a region to protect it from the Black Riders. 

If you have a good plan, just do it. We want to do things quickly and efficiently. You don&amp;#39;t need permission from me except it&amp;#39;s good to have communication for a few things, like region wide collaborations.
