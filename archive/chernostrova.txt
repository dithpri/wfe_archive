Far north beyond Terestus is the isolated Chernostrova, [i]&quot;the Dark Isles,&quot;[/i] a vast land hidden amongst the Glacial Sea&#39;s frigid, polar waters. This treacherous mare often claims those shipping vessels that dare to stray off the charted paths, while aircraft who fail to heed caution tend to vanish within the static of its hazed skies. Unnatural things, mutant, monstrous, or otherwise, haunt its bogs, taigas, and ruins, places where nature commonly batters with her fury. The machinations of the old Tzardom&#39;s war engine still rest against the rocky shores; its naval mines, and automated guns, are still alive despite the nuclear war. Among the flame-licked ruins, the civilization rises like a revenant.
