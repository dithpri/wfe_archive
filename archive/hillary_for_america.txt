[color=d41313][b]Hillary for America[/b][/color][color=423faf] is a region created by a Hillary Clinton supporter, for Hillary Clinton supporters during the hard-fought 2016 US Presidential Election. In [/color][color=d41313][b]Hillary for America[/b][/color][color=423faf], we socialized about her policies and our own views on issues! Sadly, she lost the election to her Republican rival [/color][color=red]Donald Trump[/color][color=423faf], despite winning the popular vote nationwide. We will continue our fight for progressivism throughout the next 4 years, and I hope all of you that took part had fun![/color]
