[color=#858585]As Alexander marched East, conquering and scattering whole nations to the wind, his army eventually came upon a sprawling mountain range. 

Ignoring locals who warned against it, Alexander set off through the mountain pass with a few men to see what manner of people lay to the North.

When Alexander returned, he returned alone and wild eyed. He spoke of an &#147;innumerous horde&#148; of &#147;unclean nations&#148;, poised to wreak devastation.

And he spoke little more, but set his army to work building a great wall that would span this mountain pass -- &quot;lest those Unclean Nations turn their eyes South to the civilized world.&quot;[/color]
