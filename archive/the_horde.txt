As Alexander marched East, conquering and scattering whole nations to the wind, his army eventually came upon a sprawling mountain range. A village lay before, and Alexander took his horse within to inquire as to what sort of peoples he would find waiting to the North on the other side.

He did not expect the reaction his query provoked from villagers:

   &quot;No one travels through these mountains.&quot;

   &quot;The nations lying to the North of this path are unwashed and unclean...unfit to be traversed by a civilized man.&quot;

   &quot;Barbarians.&quot;
