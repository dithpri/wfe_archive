&amp;quot;Anarchism is the great liberator of man from the phantoms that have held him captive; it is the arbiter and pacifier of the two forces for individual and social harmony.&amp;quot;- Emma Goldman

The Age of Enlightenment wishes to free man from the chains of despostism that have held it captive for so long. We beleive in the liberation of the people from tyrannical governments that would seek to establish their authority over them and force them to comply to their will. Long live freedom!
