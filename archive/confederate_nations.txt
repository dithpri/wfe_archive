Once an unofficial, background region for [region]Europeia[/region]&#39;s roleplay scene, it was eventually abandoned when their main RP scene vanished, only to be picked up by some [color=red]evil fascist[/color] who tried to use it for personal gain, to no avail. Now it shall sit here and be unavailable for anyone to claim ever again...

[color=red]This region is now under the control of [region]Stalliongrad[/region] for its association with fascism. [b]WE ARE THE PONIES OF STALLIONGRAD AND WE ARE EVERYWHERE![/b][/color]
