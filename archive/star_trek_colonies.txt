Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah! This region proved no match for a charge by corny, weird losers called &amp;quot;The Wack Riders&amp;quot; 

These mama&amp;#39;s boys have so little of a life, that they took over a region that nobody was using! Huzzah!

[color=#000061]Into the &amp;quot;battle&amp;quot; rode the following losers:[/color]

P.S. Typing text and calling it a battle makes everyone in TBR legitimate wimps and losers, confirmed and not debatable... RP is a story and everyone understands... But it is not real, it&amp;#39;s a story as said before... But waiting for update to start pushing buttons and goofing around is not a story, it is lame... 

TBR, one day you guys will get a life. Until then I will use this page to laugh at you.... 

Hooah?

Huzzah!
