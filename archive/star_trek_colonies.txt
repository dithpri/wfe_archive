The year is 2388, a time just after the USS Voyager&amp;#39;s return. Star System Alpha Four Nine Nine is home to several uninhabited yet hospitable planets. The late 2387 Treaty of Asion, named after the system&amp;#39;s star, split the planets up between several major governments. The Federation would have its say, as well as the Klingons, the Romulans and any other interested governments. 

The Klingons were the first to move in, setting up the colony of Qultuq. The first leader in the region was Chancellor Ma&amp;#39;Taq of Qultuq Colony. It will be up to him and other colonial leaders to share resources and develop trade and diplomacy in what is sure to become a crowded solar system. 

This is only the beginning. The true story has not even yet begun.
