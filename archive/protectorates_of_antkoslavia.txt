Friends from distant lands!
The Armed Empire of Antkoslavia is a wonderful, rich, and powerful state known for its splendor and prosperity, which it owes to its beloved Emperor Leader Antoni I the Magnificent of the only just Urban dynasty. Now our generous Leader has decided to take care of the smaller nations who will be ready to appear on every call from the Emperor Leader. In return, the leader of the wonderful Antkoslavia offers protection to his faithful subjects.
Comrades!
So join the Antkoslavia Protectorates eagerly and give due honor to the Emperor Leader!
Waiting and glory to our wonderful leader!

Yours sincerely, friends and Commander-in-Leader,
Secretary of Foreign Policy of Antkoslavia.
