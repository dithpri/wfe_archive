Beyond the mist, a place of gathering for worlds of fantasy and the modern born together in the dawn of 2014. We do a lot of OOC and storyline progression however on the discord. This is the primary place where we conduct ourselves, and as such the RMB may not be as active as other regions.

Our fantasy-tech protectorate: [region]The Realm of Sulesia[/region]

TFL is apart of [url=https://discord.gg/ZkMeC49WPS]Levanora Vastness[/url] (also [region]The Levanora Vastness[/region]) effort meant to build ties with our allied regions through stories and the like in a super earth/fractal earth setting.
