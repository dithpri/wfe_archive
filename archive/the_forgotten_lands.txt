Beyond the mist, a place of gathering for worlds of fantasy and the modern born together in the dawn of 2014. 

It has been our privilege to be amongst some of the best writers and role-players, to watch this region extend itself to others, to grow and remain. 

It has been a place of wonderful memories for the last nine years.

We wish you the best.

While the region is now in a holding pattern, Our discord will remain open for all too come chill and relax, talk about nationstates or whatever. [url=https://discord.gg/kFsdjNAyZN]Discord[/url]
