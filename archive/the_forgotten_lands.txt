Beyond the mist, a place of gathering for worlds of fantasy and the modern born together in the dawn of 2014. We are a role-play region with a rule of cool belief and conduct the majority of our role-play on the NS forums. We do a lot of OOC and storyline progression however on the discord. This is the primary place where we conduct ourselves, and as such the RMB may not be as active as other regions.

TFL is a role-play region for the most part, we are becoming active in a super regional role-play called [url=https://discord.gg/ZkMeC49WPS]Levanora Vastness[/url] also [region]The Levanora Vastness[/region] effort meant to build ties with our allied regions through stories and the like in a super earth/fractal earth setting.
