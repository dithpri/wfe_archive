Beyond the mist, a place of gathering for worlds of fantasy and the modern born together in the dawn of 2014. 

We are a role-play region with a rule of cool belief and conduct the majority of our role-play on the NS forums. We do a lot of OOC and storyline progression however on the discord. This is the primary place where we conduct ourselves, and as such the RMB may not be as active as other regions.

Our discord is for all too come chill and relax, talk about Nationstates or whatever. [url=https://discord.gg/kFsdjNAyZN]TFL Discord[/url]
