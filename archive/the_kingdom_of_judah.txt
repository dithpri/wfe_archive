Welcome to The Kingdom of Judah, a small but diverse region that is home to a fascinating array of cultures.
The history of Judah, the Holy Land, goes back thousands of years, with the rise and fall of numerous empires and cultures. Its heart was always Jerusalem, Judah&amp;#39;s eternal undivided capital.
It is also where the Jewish people rebuilt its home, after almost 2,000 years of diaspora.

Jews, Christians, Muslims and all others are welcome here, and you must respect the beliefs of the inhabitants.

the three holy places, Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Dome of the Rock and the Al Aqsa Mosque and the Jewish Temple are all protected.
