[b]Over a month ago, [region]The Union of Nations Against Fascism[/region] tried to take [region]League of Fascist States[/region]. However, fendas and fascist collaborators from [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=the_FRA]The Fascist Reserve Army[/url], somewhat exceeding their &amp;#39;mandate&amp;#39;) moved in, and despite resistance by UNAF, the First Battle of League of Fascist States was lost.
