After several millennia of civil war within the Korgarein Federal Empire and her surrounding territories of space, their armies and their once vast and powerful fleets left in shambles, the region was left fractured and her peoples scattered among the many star systems. Now with nearly 100 millennia past since the Great Civil War ended, several new powers, descendants of the fallen Empire, each evolving in their own new ways, as well as entirely new Races brought to the area through ruptures in space caused by weapons used during the war, have emerged vying for power and resources within the lands of the former great empire. Each is now searching for both new and old allies and lost technologies.
