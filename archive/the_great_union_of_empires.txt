Founded by Ravonica as an anti-fascist alliance, the region witnessed a long founderless period after a huge chunk of members moved to URoN . After being raided repeatedly by [region]The New Inquisition[/region] and [region]The Black Riders[/region], the region lost it&amp;#39;s identity when known defender Robert Greene usurped and locked the region.

Now liberated as a protectorate of The Bordurian Empire.
