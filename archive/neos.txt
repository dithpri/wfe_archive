Welcome to N.E.O.S, the National Ensemble Of States. Unification is important in our eyes, and we see as if it is necessary to stick together during these hard times. N.E.O.S. is welcomed to anyone and everybody that&#39;s willing to make a positive change in the world.  We plan to protect the rights of citizens and provide representation amongst all other states that intend to be unified with our region. In no way do we intend to cause harm or show any signs of hostility, the NEOS&#39; s goal is to build itself into a functional and dependable region that many can count on. Furthermore, I, Captain Nicolas, plans to build its region to the best of its capabilities and functionalities. Until the next update, I shall wish you all welcomed to NEOS.
