Marijuana is the dried leaves and flowers of the Cannabis sativa or Cannabis indica plant. Stronger forms of the drug include high potency strains - known as sinsemilla (sin-seh-me-yah), hashish (hash for short), and extracts.

Of the more than 500 chemicals in marijuana, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, known as THC, is responsible for many of the drug&#146;s psychotropic (mind-altering) effects. It&#146;s this chemical that distorts how the mind perceives the world. In other words, it&#39;s what makes a person high.
