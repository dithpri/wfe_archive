Greetings and welcome, This Region is for those who want to get involved in a Roleplay between my Nation. simply read my nation&#39;s History and try to fit your nation within it. hell create a nation and play as one of the Nations that i have made up within a few of the Factbooks. 
[b]How We Roleplay[/b] 
Simply send Telegraphs to those you are roleplaying with, make up trade deals and defense pacts and declare wars. just make sure you post what is going on internationally in the region&#39;s board. so we know. 

(btw the current year/timeline is in sync with the real time basically our nations are in sync with real world time.) 

Btw we have a Discord Server!
