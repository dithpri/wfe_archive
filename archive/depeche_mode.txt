&amp;#9939; [color=#a54040][b]Everything Counts in Large Amounts[/b][/color] ::: [u]Depeche Mode are an English electronic band formed in Basildon, Essex in 1980. The group consists of founders Dave Gahan, Martin Gore, and Andy Fletcher.[/u]

Depeche Mode&#39;s musical style shifted slightly again in 1986 with the release of their fifteenth single, &quot;Stripped&quot;, and its accompanying album Black Celebration. Retaining their often imaginative sampling and beginning to move away from the &quot;industrial pop&quot; sound that had characterised their previous two LPs, the band introduced an ominous, highly atmospheric and textured sound. Gore&#39;s lyrics also took on a darker tone and became even more pessimistic.
