[b][color=darkred]You had something to hide
Should have hidden it, shouldn&#39;t you
Now you&#39;re not satisfied
With what you&#39;re being put through
It&#39;s just time to pay the price
For not listening to advice
And deciding in your youth
On the policy of truth
Things could be so different now
It used to be so civilised
You will always wonder how
It could have been if you&#39;d only lied
It&#39;s too late to change events
It&#39;s time to face the consequence
For delivering the proof
In the policy of truth[/color][/b]
