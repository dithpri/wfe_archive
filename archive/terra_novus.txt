Terra Novus, An alternate History Earth, is in chaos, The Auroran War rages across it&#39;s surface, and eventually, even larger, more powerful events start echoing across the world, take control of one of these factions, and try to push through this grueling world, and through the deserts and glasslands afterwards. You are required to have at the very least a skeletal overview of your nation when you start roleplaying to avoid confusion and possible foul gameplay.
