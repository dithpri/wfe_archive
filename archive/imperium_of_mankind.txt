
&quot;Water. Water. Water. Water. Long ago, the water nation lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Water Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all Water elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an waterbender named UPC. And although his waterbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he&#39;s ready to save anyone. But I believe UPC can save the world.
