Taurus IV is the 4th planet in the Taurus system, a far-away and isolated corner of the High-Frontier. 

Taurus IV is a continental, geographically varied planet with a diverse biosphere of transplanted Terran and native lifeforms. It has been recently settled by a wave of colony ships that touched down on the surface ~250 years ago.
