[i]Out of many, one.[/i]

Out of many regions there is only one that promotes the ideal principles of liberty and freedom. We are a region composed of different states that come together in order to form a more perfect union and promote the general welfare of all peoples. It is a time to set aside our differences and work cooperatively to resolve the issues that faces us as human beings.

The disparate states of our region believes in one thing: democracy. For many centuries, mankind has fought to establish the principles of natural rights which among these are: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Absolutism and Tyranny are unacceptable. We are &quot;These United States&quot;.
