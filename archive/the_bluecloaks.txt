[b]Welcome to the region-page for [region]The Bluecloaks[/region]![/b] [region]The Bluecloaks[/region] is a fledgeling region that deals in both [i]Roleplaying[/i], and working as a [i]Defender region in R/D (Raiding and defending)[/i].
We are a friendly region that seeks to promote non-toxic gameplay, whilst also creating a friendly and vibrant community. TBC was founded by an experienced player who has been playing on Nationstates in various forms for nearly three years, who has finally decided to settle down and try to create a friendly experience for all nations to enjoy.
