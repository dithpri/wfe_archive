[b]This region has hit [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regolith]rock bottom[/url].  

A pack of [region]Lone Wolves United[/region] and a single, yet adept, [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=the_black_hawks]Hawk[/url] preyed upon this region while defenders were left in their somnolent state.  As predators, we fulfilled our innate calling, undeniable and unyielding.  All natives should fear the howl of our pack, and the expeditious death from above wrought by our allies.


Swift as a hawk; hungry like a wolf.[/b]
