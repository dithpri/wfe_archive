This region of the world contains a large variety of environments including the the fertile Marijuana River Valley, the JoJo Jungle (the only place where the rare animal, the non-midget, can be found), and the the vast Turd-Forged Mountains (named after their turd like appearance). The area&#39;s only inhabitants are of the allied nations of Methoptopia and JoJoLandz. Because these nation both have feared armies and do not take kindly to visitors, there is not much else know about this strange land.
