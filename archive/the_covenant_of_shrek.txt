Our mantra is: [color=red][b]SHREK IS LOVE, SHREK IS LIFE![/b][/color]
We celebrate the power of the great Shrek. For he is the right hand man to Our Lord and Savior Paul Bunyan. First and foremost we believe that it is important to get children fed... To other children as said by the lord Paul Bunyan in his holy book the Holy Maple. In Shrek 81:25, it states &amp;quot;For the children will be our sustenance, so says the lord. Xenomorphs frolic freely in between nations and those who want to join must release an entire xenomorph colony into their nation.
