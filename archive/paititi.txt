Paititi is a mythical lost city of the Incas, believed to be located east of the Andes in the rainforest of southeastern Peru, northern Bolivia, or southwestern Brazil. According to legend, the Inca hero Inkarri retired to Paititi after founding Q&#39;ero and Cuzco. Some versions describe Paititi as an Inca refuge near the Bolivia-Brazil border.
