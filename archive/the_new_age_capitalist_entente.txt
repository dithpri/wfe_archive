We are a group of individuals dedicated to the spread of capitalist ideals and the eradication of the socialist party. We believe that the only way to achieve true happiness in life is through money. We will not only further the nation itself through capitalism, we will also further the individual. For capitalism is for the consumer, and of course the capitalist. We encourage risks and bets, for what is life without a little fun. This may seem like rambling, however, if one was to analyze this mission statement, perhaps you will understand our goals better. Or perhaps it is just rambling.
