[b]Comradery[/b]. [b]Diplomacy[/b]. [b]Equal voice[/b]. [b]Political diversity[/b]. These are the traits we expect and strive for in the Unions of Fellas or UF. Here we stick together as one and provide advice and companionship for all in the UF. We also try to keep a diplomatic view and find middle grounds in arguments instead of furthering them. We also take an isolationist view of all battles happening outside of the UF. Here everyone has an equal voice and the right to voice their own opinion as long as they treat others with the respect they would want.  We also accept any one&#39;s political view or how they run their country [b]as long as they treat their citizens with respect and dignity[/b].
