Ascensia is a congress of the realms of the historic empire Ascensia. The historic Ascensia consisted of what is now referred to as Ascensionis, Aethelred, and Ascentyanis, the largest of which is Aethelred. Ascensia is a unique realm as it&#39;s realms have dramatically different governments. The purpose of Ascensia is to unite these common people to defend each other against any threat.

Although each territory maintains full authority, the Ascensian Constitution is a guideline for each of them, and over which a civil religion has sprung in the Ascensian territories, as it is considered sacrosanct, in no small part to due it being written by such legendary figures as Samoht and Uyheas, and the imperial cults which still surround them.
