welcome to the birth place of the Right and Honourable Ian Douglas Smith.

Selukwe was founded in 1899 and lies some 23 miles (37km) south-east of Gwelo.  It is the centre of a chrome and gold mining district.

The name of the town derives from a bare oval granite kopje, in the same shape as the pig pens that the BaVenda people used to build. The Venda word for &quot;pig pen&quot; is chirugwe, varied by the Matabele to Selukwe.
