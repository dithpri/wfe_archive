Welcome to [region]Etrus[/region]! Our nation is a welcoming, wonderful, and accepting environment. Please join the community, and you will be welcomed with open arms. 
         Our region stretchs to the northernmost reaches, and is filled with woodland and wildlife. We are rich in oil resources, and we are also a lumberjack hotspot. 
         We are looking for staff as well. So if you are active, and like working with me, then send a telegram and we can discuss a possible position. 
         Anyways, please join this region, and long live [region]Etrus[/region]!
