Welcome to Etrus! Our nation is a welcoming, wonderful, environment. Please join the community, and you will be welcomed with open arms. 
         Our region stretchs to the northernmost reaches, and is filled with woodland and wildlife. We are rich in oil resourses, and we are also a lumberjack hotspot.
