Welcome to [region]The Slightly Moist Cows[/region]!

We are a moist and communist/socialist region. We welcome most as long as they either have more government/state controlled industries than private and we prefer private industry to be outlawed. Anyone looking to become socialist or communist may join, but be warned that if a capitalist nation that is not looking to change joins, they will be ejected.

Enjoy the region and try to stay active!
