Welcome to Remarian... a land of self-destruction, large wastelands filled with forgotten remains of cities, precisely chopped down forests stretching for miles... and just a general lack of resources that are necessary for life. There is however, a large supply of uranium for our weapons.

Remarian is dominated by five nations, and several developing countries, currently. The capitals of which are, Cyrdemac City, Edge City, Aka&amp;#39;Vestra, Mistmyr, and Celestia. They all currently tolerate each other... barely.

There is a regional bank based in Aka&amp;#39;Vestra. The regional currency is the Brouzouf.
