Welcome to Remarian...A land of self-destruction, large wastelands filled with forgotten remains of cities, precisely chopped down forests stretching for miles...And just a general lack of resources that are necessary for life. There is, however, a large supply of uranium for your weapons.

Remarian is dominated by five nations, and several developing countries, currently. The capitols of which are, Cyrdemac City, Edge City, Aka&amp;#39;Vestra, Mistmyr, and Celestia. They all currently tolerate each other...Barely.

There is a regional bank based in Aka&amp;#39;Vestra. The regional currency is the Brouzouf.
