We are a Monarchist, peaceful Union. It consists of two parts and is the Unification of those two regions:

&#149; Austro Hungarian America
      [color=red]American Austria-Hungary[/color]
      [color=red]American-Yugoslavia[/color]
&#149; Great European Union
      [color=red]American Romania[/color]
      [color=red]Greater Iberia[/color]
      [color=red]German France[/color]

We have a dual-Leader System, that means we have one President and one Kaiser.

Leader: 
President: Bernie Sanders
Kaiser: Karl von Habsburg-Lothringen

No other Nation can Join us. But you can make Embassies with us or even a alliance.
