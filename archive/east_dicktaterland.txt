A unity of Stable and Corrupt powers into one region. East Dicktaterland is, for the most part, a passive region. The north half is a frigid winter wonderland, while the southern half is very tropical. The middle half is very unlike the others it is an empty dessert with very few animals and plants with varying temperatures and precipitation. We are a fairly new region as well, so we have much to learn from and have all the room to grow.
