[b][color=#df0000]Welcome[/color] [color=#008e6b]to[/color] [color=#df0000]Pridnestrovie![/color]

[color=#df0000]Founded 26 October 2024. Feel free to stay a while, say hello, get acquainted. We are active, don&#39;t worry.[/color]

[color=#008e6b]A proud region which has stood the test of time. Based off of the real place, known in the West as Transnistria.[/color]

[color=#df0000]Pridnestrovie does not accept degenerates, raiders or leftists of any measure for security reasons. The risk is too great from leftist raider regions. &quot;But you have a hammer and sickle flag!&quot; Yeah. That&#39;s the real-life flag of Transnistria. They&#39;re not communists either. They just haven&#39;t changed the flag since the Soviet era.[/color]

[color=#008e6b]Embassy offers from regions with the LGBT tag or Satanists will be rejected.[/color]

[color=#df0000]Pridnestrovie proudly stands with Russia against the Ukrainian serpent.[/color][/b]
