We here at Team Warrior strive to do one thing, play NationStates. We are a casual, laid-back, social type region. Join us if you think the Randomness is over 9,000. We have our own assembly, the Warrior Assembly (WA) , where members from the region of Team Warrior get together and vote on topics we can do as a region.

Warrior Assembly Leader: The Empire of McCullian Empire
Team Warrior Founder: The Protectorate of New Southern Ways


Current Allies: Congress, Dumb Land of Rebellion
