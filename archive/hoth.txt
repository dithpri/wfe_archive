&amp;quot;Hoth was the sixth planet of the remote Hoth system. 

A desolate world covered with ice and snow, located in the Anoat sector, a rarely-traveled portion of the Outer Rim Territories, it became famous as the one-time location of the Alliance to Restore the Republic&amp;#39;s Echo Base during the Galactic Civil War. 

The base was discovered by the Empire in 3 ABY, precipitating the Battle of Hoth, a major engagement that destroyed the Rebels&amp;#39; base and gave them heavy casualties.&amp;quot;
