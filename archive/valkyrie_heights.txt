A relatively small, plateau continent which was recently discovered in the Southern Atlantic.  Its terrifying cliffs are permanently surrounded by deep fogs and floating icebergs.  As a result many a lost ship can be found washed up against the shallow beaches and are seen leaning against the giant rock faces.

The region was uninhabited for centuries until a German expedition force full of colonists bound for an African adventure accidentally miraculously found the one single safe entrance into the region by sea.  Traces of a native people were found scattered across the land but they apparently disappeared mysteriously between 300 and 400 years ago.

The regional currency is the Valkyrie and is richly inhabited with Griffins.
