| |The Gildern region is a small xenophobic

| |complete irreverence towards the world
[u]| |[/u]and for being a chaotic hodgepodge of
| |divergent ideological nations.

| |The weak Gildern economy is worth 1

| |The fiercely contested debate was won

[u]| |[/u]decline establishing communication with
