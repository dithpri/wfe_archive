The Gildern region is a small xenophobic isolationist region, remarkable for its complete irreverence towards the world assembly and for being a chaotic hodgepodge of divergent ideological nations.

The weak Gildern economy is worth on average 1 medium sized potato, and the military might of Gildern is equivalent to 2 Harvins in a trenchcoat.

The fiercely contested debate was won by option 1, narrowly edging out option 2, and Gilderns overwhelmingly voted to decline establishing communication with other regions.

Gildern was rated 80,085th in the world for trashposting, scoring 69,420 on the meme rating.
