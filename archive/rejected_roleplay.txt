[b]This region was refounded by the [region]Jewish Fighting Organization[/region][/b]. 

This region was created in an attempt to create a roleplay community for The Rejected Realms. It was neglected and forgotten about. Now it is one of the holdings of ZOB. If any TRR government official wants to start a roleplay community in this region please reach out to [nation]Jewish Partisan Division[/nation].
