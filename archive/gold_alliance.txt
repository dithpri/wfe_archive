The Gold Alliance is a newly founded region. It plans on expanding and being more influential in the near future. 

Elections will be held on a monthly basis via polls. There is no limit to the number of times you may run for a position. Members are highly encouraged to compete for positions. You may vote for anyone of your choice listed in the polls, including yourself. Nations are to abide by a code of conduct, and show respect for other nations. 

Please join and work together to build a stronger, better region. Thank you.
