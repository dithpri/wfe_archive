Despite the many political differences of people throughout the world, all have come to the same conclusion at one point or another. This conclusion...is that the Great Stallard should be held in higher acclaim than anything else in this universe.

Many of the more outspoken fanatics of the Cult of Stallard came together to create their own region, where they could freely worship the Majestic Stallard without fear of being oppressed by other, more petty matters such as literally everything unrelated to the Cause of Stallard.

This region...is Stallardia.
