Once scattered groups of discontented citizens, The Incorporated Communities of Synth (TICoS) have joined together to form a new Region. The citizens seek personal freedom above all else and the government is set up to serve the citizens. Each Community controls its own population with only minor oversight by the Incorporated Councils of Synth, a group of citizen appointed individuals meant to represent and defend their rights. There are many social programs to aid the citizens and all of them are required to take aptitude tests to determine their path within the society.
