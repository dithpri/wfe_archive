We are a free continent where you can:
State your beliefs in peace, no matter how oppositional or obsolete (except offensive ideas). 
Roleplay your nation in a safe environment
Have a whole lot of fun on NationStates
Have your voice heard, because we are small
And have a good all-around time. 
So pull up to the table and eat some fried ants and mead!
