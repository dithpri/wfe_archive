Magna Terra is one of the remaining strongholds of Rome. The power of the Senate still flows through our powerful region. 
A weekly elected position of Praetor. The Praetor is a position held by two people, submitting laws through the Senate, then to the Consul. 
The Senate is made up of every nation. The Senate votes on laws by the Praetors.



Long Live the Roman Republic! 
Sen&amp;#257;tus Populusque R&amp;#333;m&amp;#257;nus!
