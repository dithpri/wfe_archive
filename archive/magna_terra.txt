Magna Terra is one of the remaining strongholds of Rome. The power of the Senate still flows through our powerful region. 
A weekly elected position of Praetor. The Praetor is a position held by two people. The Praetor makes laws. If enough support is gained, the people may change the laws. 
[b] Elections are weekly [/b]

Long Live the Roman Republic! 
Sen&amp;#257;tus Populusque R&amp;#333;m&amp;#257;nus!

Laws:
Praetors need to make the laws. They&#39;re being slackers.
