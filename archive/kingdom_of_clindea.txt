Forged in the Fires of Revolution.
Strengthened by the Bond of Brotherhood.
Urged Forward by a Common Dream.
Its Veil of Idealism Shattered.
The Bond of Brotherhood Broken by Personal Agendas.
Its Brothers and Sisters Battered and Bloodied,
Their Loyalties Tested and Betrayed,
Scattered to the Winds.
Reborn with the Purpose of Realizing THEIR dream.

--Brothers and Sisters, Welcome Home.

*Refounded In Honour of All of Our Brothers and Sisters Both Martyred and Lost in the Blood Feud, In the Hope that Their Sacrifices Were Not in Vain, and that the Dream of a Greater Clindea will be Realized. May They Find Peace.

&amp;quot;Clindea Will Rise Again&amp;quot;
