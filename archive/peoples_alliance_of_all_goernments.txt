This region was founded to secede the Alliance of Unioneers because of the founder&amp;#39;s somewhat dumb choice to relinquish powers in creating the other region, so this region was founded to give the founder the freedom to change settings. Think of it as being like the United States of America&amp;#39;s Articles of Confederation- because government was powerless, they redrafted and started over with a new Constitution. In other words, The Alliance of Unioneers was just an article, and thus the founder had to start over.
