[hr]Canarias or the Canary Islands are an autonomous community of the Kingdom of Spain, composed of seven main islands and several islets located in the Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of Africa.

The islands have chiefly a subtropical climate with warm temperatures and low annual precipitation. The population is approximately 2.15 million, with the majority living on Tenerife and Gran Canaria.

Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, with bananas being the leading crop. The tourist industry has seen rapid growth since the mid-20th century, and manufacturing industries are small-scale.
