[b][color=FCDE02]Welcome to the Dominion of Catalonia[/b]
[i]Benvingut al Domini de Catalunya[/i][/color][hr][hr][color=DB0A13]Founded on September 1, 2019, the [b][region]Dominion of Catalonia[/region] (DOC)[/b] is a self-proclaimed dominion of the [b][region]Empire of Iberia[/region] (EOI)[/b]. Such a claim, however, has not been recognized by the Iberian government as of late. The region is nominally headed by a Governor-General appointed by the Iberian government, but most power is vested in the democratically-elected Premier and the Executive Council, which serves as the Premier&#39;s cabinet and [i]de facto[/i] regional legislature. The DOC welcomes of all political ideologies and encourages citizens to take an active part in regional governance.[/color][hr][hr][b][color=FCDE02]Per Sempre Endavant! | [url=https://discord.gg/kcfsMay]Discord Server[/url] | Forever Forwards![/b][/color]
