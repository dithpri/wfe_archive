The NSPIHQ was set up with the intention of bringing together people interested with dealing in the OOC (or out of character) disputes that some nations or even entire regions may engage in.
The mission of this region is to make uniform investigations by method of questioning those involved, collecting and being able to verify evidence, and presenting all gathered information to those who need it in an easily understood format.

Dispatches will soon be written about procedure for investigation, what warrants an investigation, peer reviews, and other relevant information on NSPIHQ.
