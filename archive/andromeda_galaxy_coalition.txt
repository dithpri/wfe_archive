[b][color=blue]Welcome to the [region]Andromeda Galaxy Coalition[/region]![/color][/b]

[b]The Andromeda Galaxy is spectacular. It shows great promise of flourishing. With a new galaxy and planets to explore, nations are flocking from all ends with the intent to engrave their mark as far as the edge of space and the end of time. This new galaxy is a mere glimmer of what once was the Milky Way Galaxy, and it is their new home. We will build it to greater heights and write a new story.
