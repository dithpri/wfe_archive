A vast continent spanning thousands of miles, Pachatun has one of the most diverse geographical landscapes ever documented. Great mountain ranges and highlands flank jungles and forests with plains, steppes, and deserts in many places, indeed, there is no biome discovered that can&#39;t be found in Pachatun. Centered on the Western coastline is the rapidly growing Antekunan Empire, who seeks to claim the land of marvel as her own.
