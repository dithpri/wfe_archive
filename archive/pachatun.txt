Pachatun is a secluded continent located far from the rest of the developed world. The region is one of the most geographically diverse, home to sprawling rainforests and soaring mountain ranges as well as barren deserts and vast savannas, with a lengthy coastline and large inland sea to boot. The continent is entirely controlled by the isolationist nation of Antekuna, an unassuming federation of semi-autonomous kingdoms currently undergoing rapid changes as it&#39;s chieftain is bent on quietly pursuing it&#39;s own unique course to greatness, so that it may finally take it&#39;s place on the world stage.
