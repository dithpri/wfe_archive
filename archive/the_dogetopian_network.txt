[u][i][b]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/b][/i][/u]

This region was once an embassy region/ally to [region]Edmundian Empire[/region], and due to their involvement in the &quot;Anti J o J Coalition&quot;, this region has been seized and secured. We don&#39;t take kindly to troublemakers around these parts. The Green Banner has been raised amongst the rubble of yet another trouble maker region. You folks better get out of the way already, or you&#39;ll have your regions continue to be stomped out of existence.
