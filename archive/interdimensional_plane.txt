If anyone finds a strange man with asymmetrical clothing and a disconnect from reality wandering inside their borders ranting about leprechauns and scratch and sniff turtle cozies, we apologize. Please direct him back to the Aoristan border and try to convince him not to wander into Leziszu territory. Apparently they want to execute him for mocking the emperor, but we all know that it isn&amp;#39;t going to work. We are sorry if he causes you any inconvenience. He&amp;#39;s not actually from Aoristan, but he just sort of popped up there so everyone thinks he came from there anyways. If you see him, remain calm and contact someone. If you decide you want to keep him, that&amp;#39;s fine too just make sure you come over and get his stuff too.

This has been a PSA.
