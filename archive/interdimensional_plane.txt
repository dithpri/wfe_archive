Somewhere along the way some small secluded tribe of people had technology far advanced from our own, and they opened a portal somewhere in a small portion of Tibet. This portal reached out to other nations not directly linked to our world, but now that they are they have become interested in the other cultures of this world and each other. From the access point you can reach a number of different lands, all unique from each other and the ones found else where.
Some of the places that have been found branching out form this spot are empty, lush places jut waiting to be settled. Perhaps you belong here?
