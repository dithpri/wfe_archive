Hello, Here at Union of Socialist Americas we are here For you, we need you in the coming war against the Capitalist society in which binds us together in an illusion of freedom in which we see as the chains that bind. We need to break free and no longer be the slaves of modern day society and instead work together to accomplish a common goal to destroy the common enemy.
