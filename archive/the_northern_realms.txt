[color=blue][b]Welcome to the Northern Realms[/color]~[color=turquoise]Wilkommen in den Noorde Reelme[/color][/b]

Welcome to the place where fjords, pine forests, silvery mountains, opaline lakes, young streams, majestic waterfalls, ivory coloured glaciers, wonderful northern lights and bustling metropolis with hot chocolate served in little wooden caf&eacute;s lie. Everyone is welcome, for you are always North of someone. 

We are one of Nationstate&#39;s only elective monarchies, so if you want to become the Sovereign of our beautiful lands, just wait for the election!

We are an RP region with a map coming soon, but you can already start your own factbooks and roleplay![/b][/color]
