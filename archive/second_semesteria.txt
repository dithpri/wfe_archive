[b]Welcome to [color=darkblue]Second Semesteria![/color], home of [color=darkred]Wilmot Union High School&#39;s[/color] second semester American Government classes![/b]

In NS, we have a good little (satirical) visualizer - it can be a little silly or out there at times, but it serves as a good way to visualize government types and the impact your actions can have. As a part of this, you will create a nation and spend time with it over the semester to see how it develops. 

Please direct any questions to [nation=short]Kochanshire[/nation] ([b]Mr. Kochan[/b]) or [nation][/nation] ([b]Mr. Mudge[/b]). Please note you are subject to school rules here and must maintain proper behavior and follow all tech guidelines.
