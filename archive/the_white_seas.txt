The White Seas are a cold and rocky cluster of islands situated far in the north, within the, as the locals call it, &amp;quot;Ice waters&amp;quot;, a freezing, chilled, and often frozen stretch of icy waters.

The White Seas are politically dominated by the Empire of the Rulanza, whose Empire was built on the Rulanzan archipelago, a cluster of mountainous islands situated in the deepest, most northern area of the Seas, from where they have spread their influence to construct an Empire that dominates the majority of the White Seas.
