[color=green][i]&amp;#39;All talk to the effect that historical conditions have not yet &amp;quot;ripened&amp;quot; for socialism is the product of ignorance or conscious deception. The objective prerequisites for the proletarian revolution have not only &amp;quot;ripened&amp;quot;; they have begun to get somewhat rotten. Without a socialist revolution, in the next historical period at that, a catastrophe threatens the whole culture of mankind. The turn is now to the proletariat, i.e., chiefly to its revolutionary vanguard. The historical crisis of mankind is reduced to the crisis of the revolutionary leadership.&amp;#39;[/i]
