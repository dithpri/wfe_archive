Welcome to the Royal Alliance Of Royalist States
Here, you will feel alone, we never communicate and will not welcome you into our region with open arms. Here, you can not get in contact through telegrams with people in power who will not listen to you and not accept suggestions. Nations who are not very active will be promoted through the ranks. 
We don&#39;t have any aristocratic titles for those notable members of society.
Viscount Frog Of Deepcut, Minister Of Public Information
