The children of Ramsay may seek refuge in many places but are refused for &quot;extreme beliefs&quot; and &quot;hatred of non chefs&quot; but this shall happen no more. Any children of Ramsay needing a place of worship may seek protection in the only region on earth that actively worships the one true God, and prevents worship of false gods.
