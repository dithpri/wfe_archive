The Spherical League was founded by the Southern Blue Orb as a way to unite all of the colored orb states in the world. Any colored orb is welcome, regardless of political policies: the only ideology that is required is a fundamental belief in the ultimate superiority of circles, spheres, and hyper-spheres over all other shapes. Currently, the Southern Blue Orb controls admission, so send a telegram to be given the password.
