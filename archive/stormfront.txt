[b]Stormfront[/b] is a white nationalist, white supremacist and neo-Nazi Internet forum that was the Web&#39;s first major racial hate site.

Stormfront began as an online bulletin board system in the early 1990s before being established as a website in 1996 by former Ku Klux Klan leader and white supremacist Don Black. It received national attention in the United States in 2000 after being featured as the subject of a documentary, Hate.com. Its prominence has grown since the 90s, attracting attention from watchdog organizations that oppose racism and antisemitism. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
