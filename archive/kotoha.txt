(Yes I really am copy pasting a tag I found, it&#39;s too awesome. Don&#39;t mind me! TG [nation]Sakurakouji Kinako[/nation] if you want me to take it down.)
[color=blue][b]Hey! The [region=Blanket Fort Legion] ventured out beyond their fortress, on a mission to raise the moon and lower the sun, wrapping this region in an eternal lullaby.[/b][/color]

[color=purple][i]Now the hour has come at last
The soft and fading light
Has crossed the west horizon
And has bidden us goodnight
And what a lovely night it is
To walk a moonlit field
To see the softer shades
That are by starlight now revealed[/i][/color]

[color=blue][b]After leaving you a yummy cake, we signed our names in the icing![/b][/color]
