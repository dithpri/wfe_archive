Uh, this is a region now, you should join. I haven&#146;t really decided on what this region will be focused on, but if you join you can help decide. So, if you wanna help shape a region then you should definitely think about moving here, or moving a puppet here, thats cool too.

Some overview of Muntenia. Muntenia is a region of Romania, usually considered Walachia, it holds the Romanian capital, Bucharest (Bucuresti). However this region does not have to be based on Romania or Muntenia, I just named it Muntenia because I&#146;m lazy and can&#146;t think of names.
