This region is for those who were banned from [region]Orion[/region] by the unjust regime of [nation]Mitigandae[/nation] and [region]Orion[/region] refugees. This region&amp;#39;s WA Delegate cannot access the Regional Control, so invading us is pointless.

[b]Update:[/b]Looks like [nation]Mitigandae[/nation] has stopped playing. Normally I would say its time to move back to [region]Orion[/region], but he has been replaced by [nation]Circinus IV[/nation]. So far he has abolished the flag, banned 2 nations, and removed the World Factbook Entry. It remains to be seen whether we should move back or not.
