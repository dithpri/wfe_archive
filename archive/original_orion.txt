This region is for those who were banned from [region]Orion[/region] by the unjust regime of [nation]Mitigandae[/nation] and [region]Orion[/region] refugees. This region&amp;#39;s WA Delegate cannot access the Regional Control, so invading us is pointless.

[b]Update:[/b]It would appear that [region]Orion[/region] has been liberated by [region]Union of Free States[/region]. Unfortunately, they set a password and have failed to give it to me. I&amp;#39;m currently awaiting news from [nation]Virgin Queen[/nation], who is the current WA Representative.
