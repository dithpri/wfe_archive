This region is for those who were banned from [region]Orion[/region] by the unjust regime of [nation]Mitigandae[/nation] and [region]Orion[/region] refugees. This region&amp;#39;s WA Delegate cannot access the Regional Control, so invading us is pointless.

[b]Update:[/b]It would appear that [region]Orion[/region] has been liberated by [region]Union of Free States[/region]. And they have now proved to be no better than the previous invaders. [region]Orion[/region] has been annexed as a territory of [region]Union of Free States[/region] because we failed to participate in the liberation. Looks like this region will be our permanent home.
