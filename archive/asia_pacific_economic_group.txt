Asia Pacific Economic Group (APEG)

Since its inception in 2007, the APEG region has consistently been the most economically dynamic part of the world. APEG Member Economies generated nearly 70 percent of global economic growth and the APEG region consistently outperformed the rest of the world. We believe in non-intervention of other nation state affairs.
