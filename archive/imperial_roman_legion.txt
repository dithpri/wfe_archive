[color=b70909][b]Welcome, to the Imperial Roman Legion[/b][/color]
[hr][color=585555][b]We are a region dedicated to establishing a Roman Imperial government on NationStates. Your journey begins as a citizen of Rome, and you build your career as you advance in the community. Become a Legionnaire today, and perhaps one day you will serve as a Legatus Legionis in the Senate.[/b][/color]
[hr][i]&quot;Astra inclinant, sed non obligant&quot; -- The stars incline us, they do not bind us. We believe in the authority of the state, and the inevitable fate of the universe that presides over us, however the Imperial Roman Legion greatly values free will and stoic ideals. All faiths and ideologies are welcome, but in the Imperial Roman Legion, all citizens must accept the Emperor Augustus Maximus, the Military, and the Senate.[/i]
