The lands of Vrerfaet have been a mess for thousands of years, and have yet to become one culture or force. However, the inhabitants have agreed that they are all from the same realm; Vrerfaet. On this agreement, the land was labeled the United Regions of Vrerfaet, or URV for short. The URV has drawn up a map of the regions, which is distributed to the inhabitants of the lands. Newcomers to the realm must have some right to claim land, or else their country will be considered a sub-country within a larger one.
