The lands of Vrerfaet have been a mess for thousands of years, and have yet to become one culture or force. However, the inhabitants have agreed that they are all from the same realm; Vrerfaet. On this agreement, the land was labeled the United Regions of Vrerfaet, or URV for short. The URV has drawn up a map of the regions, which is distributed to the inhabitants of the lands.
