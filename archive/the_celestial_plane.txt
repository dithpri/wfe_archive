We are what we are. We are what you want. We shall weather all storms. Alliances shall be discussed and we shall never break them. We bend but do not break. You raid we reform, better then ever. We shall be your mercenaries and we shall discuss the price.

&amp;quot;We shall grow. Just you wait.&amp;quot;
