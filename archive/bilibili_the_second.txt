Yep


[Intro]
I keep holdin&#39; on

[Verse]
Broken footsteps on the floor
Pick myself up and carry on, &#39;cause something&#39;s waiting for me
And I won&#39;t let them wreck my soul
Keep my direction and soon I&#39;ll&amp;#65279; be turned to gold

[Build-Up]
A king without a throne, a heart without a home
Just cards that I&#39;ve been dealt in life
I walk the road alone, but my hope will never die

[Drop]
But my hope will never die
My hope will never die
My hope will never die
I keep holdin&#39; on x2
