The nation of Sarawak is a supposedly autonomous state of the Federation of Malaysia. It is located on the South East Asian island of Borneo (The third largest island in the world and the largest island in Asia). 

Sarawak is a land rich in resource and has been a part of Malaysia for 50 years. The state has been pillaged of these riches by aggressive neo-colonialists in the Western part of Malaysia where the Federal office is located. 50 years ago, Sarawak was the richest state in Malaysia. Today, Sarawak is the poorest. There has been great frustration over the federal government and some groups have even called for separation from the Federation.
