[b][region=The Black Hawks] have attempted to claim this region. It&#39;s quite sad really. Don&#39;t they have lives at all? Guess not.

Neckbeards involved:
Lieutenant [nation=Antiochus Denral]: Illiterate.
Major [nation=Reventus Koth]: Has no friends.
Sergeant [nation=Yuno Hawk]: Failed first grade.
Corporal [nation=Atraire]: Has never even seen a woman.
PFC [nation=Moneys Raiding Toy]: Literally a Neanderthal.
PFC [nation=Brotherhood of Guns]: Lives in his mom&#39;s basement.
With Help from:
KoGB&#39;s HMCRM, because they&#39;re too stupid to do anything themselves and needed help.[/b]
