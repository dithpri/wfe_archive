Apparently we were featured and so some troll nation came in and voted themselves WA delegate.

Then some other random nations came in, voted themselves delegates and kicked out the troll nation.

:/

Since it&amp;#39;s obviously very easy for anyone to just come in and become delegate, I&amp;#39;ve taken away the delegate&amp;#39;s power to mess with the region. Wouldn&amp;#39;t want trolls breaking things.
