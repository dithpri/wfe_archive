Only 300 years ago in this region, there were the grand purges, in which people thought to have right wing views were rounded up and tried by ducking. Safe to say, they all drowned. After the region had rid itself of people with right wing views, they realized that in enforcing these rules, they had in fact become right wing. So they all decided to calm down a bit. Now the people of this region live in peace and harmony because even the people who think right wing thoughts realize that the strong economy, excellent political freedoms and very good civil rights stems only from the fact that it&amp;#39;s a left wing region.
