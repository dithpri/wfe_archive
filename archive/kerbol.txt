This is the companion region to [region]Kerbin[/region], geared towards more casual KSP-related RP. The year is 2071 at the start of the RP, and Kerbals have colonized much of the Kerbol system.

Some ground rules: An RPer may have no more than three nations here, and the other two must be smaller than the main. Also, an RPer cannot control the dominant nation on more than one body.
