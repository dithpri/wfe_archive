Welcome to the reality you were put in and the one you have choosen to praise and endorse..! [i]dead silence[/i]
The Karal is the single common word in ancient Spiral language to refer to the maximum understanding, concept, perception (and to be updated)! of existence as a whole! the most overly meta rp inside this rp game is shown to your faithful eyes and your shaky little fluffless human hands; both filled with endless roaming willdpower! (not typo intended ;) ) The spiral of constant sensations drive us to archieve not our best, but our last, not our right, but our far, and not our circle but [i]our[/i] spiral.
