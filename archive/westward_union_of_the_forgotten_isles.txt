The westward union of the forgoten isles or (WUTFI) is an alliance of former colonies within the forgotten Isles. WUTFI is a very loose organization, that is relatively open to most nations on the islands. The forgotten isles is located in the south Atlantic and has no natives. The islands were &#147;forgotten&#148; due to it&#146;s lack of important resources.
