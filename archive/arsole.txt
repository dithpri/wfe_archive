The Arsole region exists entirely on a plateau elevated miles above the planets surface. Because of this, those who live in the nations in Arsole experience time faster than those elsewhere in the world. They age faster but also are hip to new fashion trends before everyone else. Occasionally, low-orbit satellites whiz by over the homes of the people living in Arsole. Some nations have attempted to petition the World Assembly to prevent this while others enjoy the amazing TV reception.
