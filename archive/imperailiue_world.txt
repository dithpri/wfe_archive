This is a world that is planning to be largely based off of the world from Imperialism (video game), specifically the first and fourth tutorial worlds, as well as the names and likenesses of the &quot;Fixed&quot; world setting&#39;s countries.  The video game was developed by Frog City Software and published by Strategic Simulations in 1997; we do not represent them, and as such, we don&#39;t own the original concept, they do.
