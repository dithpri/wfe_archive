A safe haven for nations who will be only minimally active. A great fit for those not looking to invest too much time into this game. But still want their nation to be here when they get back. Also, feel free to leave and come back to this region whenever you want. But please stage coups elsewhere.

REGIONAL RULES: 

1.) Do NOT share the password with everyone. If you send out the password and share with a large group, many people can join at once and then vote to change regional control to one of their number. Giving them the power, ability to troll, and effectively kill this region.

2.) Please do NOT vote power away from me. I know how that sounds, but I know that I don&amp;#39;t want to troll. My only goal is to protect my nation and region.
