Welcome to the Outlands 2. A spinoff of the original region, we are home to the countries that are just plain weird. Do you have a bizarre flag or history? Have your recent issues resulted in strange trends or other events? Are your policies inherently self-contradictory? If the answer to one or more of these is yes, then you might just belong here.

Side note: We are quite tired of being invaded.
