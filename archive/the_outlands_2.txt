[b][color=orange]The stranger cousin of [region]The Outlands[/region][/color][/b]

Not every country is logical. Some are just plain weird, continuously making strange decisions and just generally being abnormal. Life is strange, and The Outlands II is a region for countries that reflect that. Any country, as long is it is strange, is welcome here.
