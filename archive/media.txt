After the fall of the Assyrian Empire a unified Median confederacy was formed which together with Babylonia, Lydia, and Egypt became one of the four major powers of the ancient Near East. The Medes were able to establish their  kingdom with Ecbatana as their royal centre beyond their original homeland in western Iran and had a territory stretching roughly from eastern Iran to the Halys River in Anatolia.
