Life can be tough. Sometimes there will be people who just want to mess you up. Tired, beat down, hopeless refugees of NS, you are welcome here. If you have been harassed, neglected, unfairly rejected, this is the place for you. Hot chocolate, and warm blankets are in abundance. If you want to share your story, you can, but you don&#146;t have to.

 Invaders will be ejected. If you make any purposely condescending, rude, or harassing comments you will be covered in Flex Tape, and promptly banned. This region is a safe haven for ALL.
