This is a group of nations risen from the ashes of the world left behind. From Eurasian-controlling Sino-Soviet Union, to the imperialist, competitive United States, rose four nations; the People&#39;s Republic of Northern America, the Reformed Union of Southern Peninsulas, the Confederacy of South America, and the Union of United Bolsheviks. Following nuclear war, these nations struggle to rebuild what is left of the world, colonizing outwards from the americas and siberia to the rest of the world, although hindered by large wasteland zones.
