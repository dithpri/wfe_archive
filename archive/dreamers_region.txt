Here at Dreamers Region, we like peace. In fact, we like it so much, that we prefer to talk out our disputes rather than go to war over it. What can I say? I just guess that we are leaders with proud mothers.

Unfortunately, not everyone is like that. Some people prefer to have a war any day. So, in order to protect ourselves, we have a password gate. However, you can apply to join Dreamers Region [url=http://goo.gl/forms/6B3kag1DPk]here[/url].
