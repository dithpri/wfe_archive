The Dreamers Region is a peaceful region. Home to nations that would prefer to settle differences through talking, rather than going to war. But let it be known that we will not stand around and do nothing while our region is being invaded.

To invaders who are still here: This has been the fourth time that you have invaded while our founder isn&amp;#39;t here. These raids are getting very, very annoying for us all. So if you would be so kind, leave if you are planning to invade us.

In order to ensure that the Dreamers Region isn&amp;#39;t invaded for a fifth time, please endorse [nation]Diventoria[/nation] if you are a WA member.
