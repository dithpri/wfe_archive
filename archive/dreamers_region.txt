The Dreamers Region is a peaceful region. Home to nations that would prefer to settle differences through talking, rather than going to war. But let it be known that we will not stand around and do nothing while our region is being invaded.

The founder of this region, Have Fun with it, was originally a member of [region]Yggdrasil[/region], and kept close ties to the region until his disappearance.
