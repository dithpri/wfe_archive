The Dreamers Region is normally a very peaceful region. Home to nations who would rather go about arguments in a civil way, instead of waging war. Although this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that we will stand by and watch our region fall to raiders. 

If you are an invader and are still here, leave. Your raids are getting annoying

Since our founder isn&amp;#39;t here at the moment, it would be greatly appreciated if any WA members endorse [nation]Diventoria[/nation] to ensure that the Dreamers Region will not be invaded for a third time.
