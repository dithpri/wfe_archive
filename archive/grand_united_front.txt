The GUPF, Grand United Front, Grand United People&#39;s Front, or GUP is a newly-founded region with a few states in it. 

Hoping to be better, the Founding nation moved out of [region]The North Pacific[/region] to found this one. Hopefully this region can become what I had hoped.

Soon, it began it&#39;s conversion to a Frontier, hoping to bring in new nations.
