The UGN allows any Nation or form of government into its borders. So long as you abide by the laws and rulings of Executives, delegates, and officers. Remember that we are all here to work together. So, violence, threats, etc. wont be tolerated. But I&#39;m not going to kick you for jokes or mild insults just don&#39;t get carried away. Lastley, we won&#39;t be voting on any officer positions, delegates, etc. Only I have final ruling over those decisions. However, we can vote on other things here like appearances. And NO this isn&#39;t a gay region, gaystapo is a joke...
