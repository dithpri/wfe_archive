Tormion is a brand new region where some nations may choose to move in order to create a new society away from the current and longstanding powerhouses of the world.

In Tormion, each individual nation has equal say, as we prefer a system of direct democracy wherein each nation has one vote.

Any nation may propose an idea that may be voted in; a number of votes equivalent to one third of the region (or greater) considering it important will result in that idea moving to the grand stage, wherein the whole region will have the ability to vote.
