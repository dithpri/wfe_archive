After several defacing encounters, I have decided to add a Customs Office to restrict entrance into the region. 

The whole point of the region was to be a place of solitude, void of any sort of &quot;noise&quot; , just peaceful existence. 
No polls, no notifications, no &quot;noise&quot;.

If you genuinely wish to live by this peace, then please feel free to reach out.
