(Do excuse the rather silly name, my options for my intent were limited) Welcome to the United Empire of Boletaria, Lordran, and Drangleic! An empire whose bonds have been forged in the wake of the supernatural curses that befell them, these three great nations have all banded together as one, in a bid to dominate all of creation as is our right! A new region, filled with nearly limitless hopes and dreams to those who come! All are welcome, even those not familiar with the Souls&#39; series, and we want active members to help build this up and create a wonderful family! Come and, with me, found what is to hopefully become the newest great power in NationStates! (The link to the forum is: http://w11.zetaboards.com/The_Souls_Empire/index/ )
