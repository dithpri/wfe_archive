Satarius is a planet on the other side of the Milky Way galaxy. There are 5 main continents: Rolla, Rollan, Nucleus, Atlantanea, and Cultio.

We are a role-playing region and would love to have you join us.
Any questions can be directed to Atlantanea.

Maps for role-playing will be coming soon.
