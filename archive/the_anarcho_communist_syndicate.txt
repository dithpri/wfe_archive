
Welcome Comrades!

The Anarcho Communist Syndicate is based around the ideas of Freedom, Equality, Fraternity and Peace. We welcome leftists of all kinds and take in refugees. ALL decisions are made via direct democracy/polling/ only and there are no hierarchical positions.

The Founder and the WA Delegate have no power whatsoever and should only transmit the regional decision made via polling.
