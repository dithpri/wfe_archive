This region is the wholly owned subsidiary of [region]Altmora[/region]. The VI Chad Legion was disappointed at the relative ease of their victory. Stalin was a monster but his communist hordes had steel in their spines.

Let this serve as a reminder: the Left is on the wrong side of history. The Right is in harmony with history, science, and human nature.
