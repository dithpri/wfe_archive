After a 30 year war with the aliens that came through a portal in NYC, the world has finally settled and come to peace. Nations are scarred by war, yet are very welcoming to the idea of world peace and try to quarrel with other nations as little as possible. Meme Topia, the nation that founded this quaint region, has executive control and tries it&#39;s best to keep everyone happy(as long as they conform to it&#39;s liberal values). Some say that this region is very controlling and does not listen to people&#39;s opinions, so these citizens are not used to having their voices be heard. The year is 2040, and the leader with the most power is Doge Cena, leader of Meme Topia.
