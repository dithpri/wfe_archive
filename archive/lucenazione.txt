Lucenazione, the Nation of Light, was founded by [nation]Lucecittia[/nation] in the year 2014. Mostly a pacifist region, Lucenazione understands the need of force to sometimes keep peace.
[region]Lucenazione[/region] was intended to be a needed addition to the World Assembly, one that would prioritize safety, and political liberty, over the desire to use force for gain.
The foxes in the flag symbolize the nations in the World Assembly. The red and yellow stripes symbolize the seemingly different desires of each nation, while the connecting orange stripes and the orange of the fur (red and yellow) illustrates how the nations, for the most part, want the same thing. The foxes also symbolize unity.
