[b]Welcome!
[/b]
[region]Progress Valley[/region]  is a young  and small region open to everyone. (A lot of stuff is still not done)

Our region promotes democracy, justice, general welfare, peace and liberty. I, the founder, [nation]Praethonia[/nation] encourage new members to also be brave to discuss their political beliefs in this region. I hope that everyone feels welcome here.

Since our region is young and new, there is still a lot of stuff that has to be done. As the region grows, we will elect officers and form a common law where our shared values will be enshrined.
