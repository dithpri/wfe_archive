Rising from the ashes of Second Impact, the Land of Wannabes persevered for many years, working hard to restore the damage caused by the regionwide catastrophe. The region&amp;#39;s leader, Xernid, is currently petioning for all the nations in Xernid to create their own &amp;quot;NERV&amp;quot; branch to help combat a strange race of beings known only as the Angels.

Current NERV Branches
NERV-1: GeoFront (Primary Military Citadel)
NERV-2: The Black Citadel (Arms Manufacturing)
NERV-3: Camaho City (Research and Development)

We in the Land of Wannabes also hold to the disbelief in the WA and its pitifully stupid &amp;quot;resolutions.&amp;quot; Self-governance via regions is far more effective, and appeals more to the sectionalism that has sprung up in much of the world.
