Attention all nations of the NEA.

Your oppressors have been defeated by an unnamed group of heroes.  Oppressors? You ask.

This nation was ran by a group of friend&amp;#39;s who forced their own opinions.  They forced their own bills down the people&amp;#39;s throats and payed no attention to the warnings.   YOU HAVE BEEN LIBERATED, NEA NATIONS!  You no longer have to follow the unjust bills proposed by Givana and the sort.   Your nation is your business, and the New earth headquarters is glad to make itself your home.

This Region is now officially a protectorate of  Ergodia!
