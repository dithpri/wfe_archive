To all of the Great Nations of the World,

Now, after that disastrous attack upon us, I have stabilized the Socialist Collective and am now looking to swell its ranks. Of you are new or just simply looking for a home, come check us out. If you have additional questions, please send a Telegram to the United Federation of Sovereign Republics and I, the founder of this region, shall answer you promptly and personally. 

With respect, 

Tyler Golden 
Chancellor of the UFSR 
Founder of the Socialist Collective
