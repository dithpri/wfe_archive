To all you Socialist States, your new World starts here. Only through collective security will our nations prosper. I am open to all new nations, and am excited to see who comes forth. Whether you are socialist, communist, fascist, democratic, liberal, or conservative is of no consequence. My nation itself is moderate, leaning left. If your into role-playing, awesome! I enjoy doing that sort of thing as well. Many Regions overwhelm you by having hundred of members. But with the Collective, your nation can prosper and grow in a safe and secure environment. So join now, before membership swells. We welcome all!

Yours, most sincerely, 

The Socialist Collective
