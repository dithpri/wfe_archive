My brothers and sisters, 

I built this region to be a haven for all nations. We all have our own beliefs, our own customs, our own abilities! This is why the Collective exists as it does; this region exists to grant protection and friendly relations between nations. Only together can we confront our enemies with courage in our hearts! Only together can we ensure our existence and shout proudly that we will not go quietly into the night! Only together can we ascend to greatness! Because know this my Comrades, that through the power of our unshakable will we shall stand proudly and defiantly and united with one goal in mind: WE WILL SURVIVE!
