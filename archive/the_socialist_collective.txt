It is with great shock that I report the damage done to my region. It is a catastrophe unlike anything I have encountered. But out of the ashes of this tragedy comes the fire of hope. This is an opportunity to rebuild, to reform. My allies I commend thee for thy loyalty and now beg you to aid me in my reconstruction. We shall rebuild and grow until me are once again proud of our region and nothing will stand in our way. Through peace, diplomacy, compromise and cooperation shall we rise again, greater and far more tolerant than before!
