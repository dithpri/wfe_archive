It&#39;s 1991, and the USSR ( CCCP, Soviet Union ) has fallen. The nations inside of this region are the remains of the Republic, now all on their own.

As the region of the former united nation is now split apart, the new nations must shall work together, to keep the legacy of the USSR strong and alive.

Some nations may keep socialism and communism, and some may go from the past and become democratic. And then there is a mix of all.
