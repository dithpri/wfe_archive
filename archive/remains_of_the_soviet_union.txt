[color=red]Welcome to The Remains Of The Soviet Union![/color]

 We are an alternative history region. The region&#39;s story take&#39;s place in 1991, and the Soviet Union has offically fallen. Instead of the union breaking up and forming the nation&#39;s we know of today, the union split&#39;s into even more nations ( like yours ). Instead of a united nation, we are a [color=blue]United Region[/color], and we shall work together.

Our location of our region is all of the Soviet Union. Here for a better image: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg

Motto: &quot; May The Legacy Stay Strong, May The Legacy Live! &quot;

[color=black] Please show your support for our region by endorseing the nation&#39;s below! [/color] We hope you enjoy your time here!
