In the name of the Great Eagle
We do solemnly swear to promote
A world in which all men can learn,
Grow, and truly soar high above the clouds. For the good of all mankind,
We strive to soar above the clouds, 
Seeking a day when all men can 
Achieve greatness. In the name of
The Great Eagle do we strive to 
Soar above the clouds
