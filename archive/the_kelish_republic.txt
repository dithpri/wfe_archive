The Kelish Republic shall permit any nation which is proven to be descended from the Ancient Kel Empire and the subsequent Ancient Kel Confederacy, and which has been deemed cooperative enough by The Lord President, to join our Republic as a full member nation. Any other countries which desire to join may petition The Lord President to be a protectorate or territory of the Kelish, and while not full member nations, shall be given adequate protection or guidance in accordance to each nation&#39;s needs and requests. Additionally, the independence of said nations will be granted wherever possible except in situations which the Kelish have deemed extreme and necessary.
