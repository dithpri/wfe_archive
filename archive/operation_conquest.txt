War....War never changes.
Progress, Conquer and Destroy. Conquer land and destroy your enemies, If its hostile you kill it.
Be political or religious, or destroy your enemies. Crusades or Military Operations, crush them one way or another.

We all incourage others to join us, keep things interesting.. Keep a little competition. But the conflicting political views are where it is.
