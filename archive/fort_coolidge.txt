[b]About Coolidge[/b]

Calvin Coolidge was the 30th President of the United States, renowned for promoting small government conservatism. He reduced spending, decreased regulation, and cut taxes dramatically; furthermore, he signed the Indian Citizenship Act, and his strong support of civil rights caused the KKK to lose its foothold on the government. He left office very popular, and his reputation peaked during the Reagan administration.
