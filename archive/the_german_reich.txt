Hallo Kamerad! Welcome to the Deutsches Demokratische Republik (The German Reich) a place were you can work in a factory or take a walk along the Berlin Wall. The Deutsches Demokratische Republik is a place that welcomes all people (except capitalist bastards) and is a land were communism is glorified. If you are interested in joining the Workers Party of Deutschland join the WA and endorse your Glorious Leader Kim Il Sung.
