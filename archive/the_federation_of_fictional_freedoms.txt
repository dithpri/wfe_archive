A long time ago, the world was a cesspool of blasphemy, filled with hatred and nations battling and wreaking bloodshed. Lies spread through every ear like... earwigs, or something or whatever. Anyways, back to the story. There came a time, when even the bravest and the stupiderest, would not dare to dream, but there was one man.... ONE MAN! That saved them all... And his name was.... JOHN CENA!!! Just kidding, that meme is dead. He was actually names General Yoohoo. I know. Boring name. Right? Anyway... Blah blah blah. Civil war. Countries dead. A couple nukes. And then it was now.
