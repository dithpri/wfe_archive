The Totallia Region is the long lost remnants of the old Karvaldian Region, lost to nuclear war. Some nations made it through the blast, others didn&#39;t, and some are back under a different government. Although the soil may still be the same, the people and landscape certainly aren&#39;t. Totallia has a meaning to it, it represents the total destruction of the Karvaldian Region as we know it.
