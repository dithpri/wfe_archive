[i]Everyone in the Simonosphere knows the legend of Majestia. Most of us don&#146;t care too much about it, but I wanted to see the darkness within the legend. So I piloted a helicopter above the area. At first, it was dark. It was dark for days. Then, on January 2, 2025 at 13:54, a light shone in the sky. After 324 days, the death stars have cleared, revealing the sky. I looked at the atom of Majestia from the raid of February 13. Glowing under the blue sky, it multiplied&#133;and multiplied&#133;until a small island was formed. And I will protect this island forever.

Thank you, Improper Classifications. Je me souviens.[/i]
