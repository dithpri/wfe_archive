Majestia is a large archipelagic region near the Equator that has beautiful wildlife and fertile soil. It is the perfect region for nations with land on another planet, whether it&#39;s imaginary or not. (Hey, that includes Earth!) Majestia will be your &#147;outpost&#148;. And if you have puppet states, please bring them with you. This is Puppet State Paradise.
If you claim an unclaimed island here, you&#39;ll probably notice 5 million people randomly spawning on the island and growing the population at an extreme rate. The island&#39;s size will grow as well and the other islands will move away from your growing island if it gets too close. You might even notice your island covered in fog and World Census being unable to figure out how big your country is.
