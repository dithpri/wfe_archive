Majestia is a large, archipelagic, embassy collector region near the Equator that has beautiful wildlife and fertile soil. If you have puppet states, please bring them with you. This is Puppet State and Space Empire Paradise.
If you claim one of Majestia&#39;s 17000+ unclaimed islands here, you&#39;ll probably notice 5 million people randomly spawning on the island and growing the population at an extreme rate. The island&#39;s size will grow as well and the other islands will move away from your growing island if it gets too close. You might even notice your island covered in fog and World Census being unable to figure out how big your country is.
All Majestian embassies are on [nation]Embassy Island[/nation]. Embassy nations are welcome to roleplay and chitchat.
