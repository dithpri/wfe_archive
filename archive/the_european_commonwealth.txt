The European Commonwealth lay abandoned by its founder, beset on all sides by enemies, mired in the mud.
Then came Gorky Novgorod, who on the orders of the Admiral of the [region]Scrapheap[/region] refounded the region, allowing its founder to reside permanently within it.

Should you wish to view the RMB (or anything else) of the region prior to being refounded, I preserved it in the Wayback Machine, [url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200422114103/https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_european_commonwealth]here[/url].

This region is now the domain of [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1352059]the Grand Imperial Army of the Scrapheap, which doth UwU greatly[/url].
Questions may be addressed to [nation]Istria and Izsac[/nation], the Admiral of the Scrapheap.

[i]Stand firm. Never give up, Never give in. Let it come.
