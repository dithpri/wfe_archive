This region takes its name for the Latin term for &amp;quot;Volcanic Islands&amp;quot;. The geographical and topographical origins of this region are from massive volcanic eruptions in the ocean. These volcanoes created several islands of different sizes from their explosive eruptions, as well as their rise from the sea. 

Several hundred years later, people from different backgrounds began to settle on different islands, and created communities and governments that have survived the test of time. Today, the region is populated by several different countries with many different political backgrounds and beliefs.
