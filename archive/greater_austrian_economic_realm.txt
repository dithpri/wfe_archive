I was shooting heroin and reading &#147;The Fountainhead&#148; in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.
&#147;Bad news, detective. We got a situation.&#148;
&#147;What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?&#148;
&#147;Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars&#146; worth of bitcoins.&#148;
The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. &#147;What kind of monster would do something like that?
