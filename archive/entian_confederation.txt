This region is a whole country that is woven from hundreds of other countries, like a quilt. The policy of past governments has led to this result, which, however, must determine the fate of certain regions of the country once and for all. And now, hundreds of commune cities begin to struggle against each other to unite the lands of the former Empire under the banner of their ideology. And let in this struggle the best for a life of people a community.
Be glorious Entia in the Ages, and let luck accompany us!
