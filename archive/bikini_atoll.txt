[b]Bikini Atoll[/b] is an atoll in the Marshall Islands. The atoll consists of 23 islands totaling 3.4 square miles surrounding a deep 229.4-square-mile central lagoon at the northern end of the Ralik Chain, approximately 54 miles northwest of Ailinginae Atoll and 530 miles northwest of Majuro. 

Between 1946 and 1958, 23 nuclear devices were detonated by the United States at seven test sites located on the reef, inside the atoll, in the air, or underwater. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
