[b]You came.[/b]  

You came to this place for any number of reasons.  But now, as you stare across a landscape of fire and brimstone and flesh and metal, that reason escapes you.  You fear that you may forget the sun as well.  All that hangs in the sky is that great eye.  You wish you could leave.  You wish you could scream.  You miss the time when you could move your arms and legs, when your mouth was not gaping open for the birds to feed you with.  You feel nostalgic for the days when you a whole being, and not a single object in an infinite beast, possessed with a hunger not your own.
