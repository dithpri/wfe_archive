Welcome to [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Avenue]Pennsylvania Avenue[/url], home to the White House, among other important United States landmarks. Thankfully, security here isn&amp;#39;t as tight as it has to be on the real Pennsylvania Avenue, so feel free waltz in anytime, whether it&amp;#39;s to suggest something to the Bartlet administration or just to see the sights.
