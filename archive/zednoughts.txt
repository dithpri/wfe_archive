The Zednoughts are a group of artists, creators, and apocalypse junkies with a bigger picture in mind than their own simple well-being. While being a powerful tool for collaboration with fellow creators having mutual interests, the main goal of The Zednoughts community is to abolish the notion that in the event of a disaster, (be it zombies, earthquakes, or those darn Mayans again) everyone must inherently become part of the problem. A Zednought will always hold in value the lives of the innocent and helpless higher than their own, even if they must pay the ultimate price for it. This call to virtue may be too much for many to accept, but for those with the hearts of lions and a better future in mind;
