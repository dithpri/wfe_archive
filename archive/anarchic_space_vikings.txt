The Anarchic Space Vikings were a lost tribe of Vikings who colonized a small unexplored island, taking possession of this island meant taking heads, which was no problem for the Viking host, who then adapted the human skull as its form of currency from the headhunter tribe it pacified.

1500 years passed, a 21st century explorer landed on the island changing Viking society forever.  Trading the rich minerals left behind by a volcano on the island and the deep water oil rights, they quickly built a space program in order to expand there raiding parties around the globe and beyond.
