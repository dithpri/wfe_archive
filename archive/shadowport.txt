The Shadowport began as a Karzstov military resupply base in the late Imperial Expansion Era (Year 318 by Velkara reckoning). With the rise of the global black market, it evolved into an &#147;open compliance zone&#148; &#151; a legal loophole allowing foreign traders, smugglers, mercenary fleets, and cyber-syndicates to operate under Karzstov &#147;oversight&#148; in exchange for taxation and silence.

Over the last century, it has grown into Velkara&#146;s largest illicit trade hub, officially recognized as autonomous but firmly under the Emperor&#146;s covert control through loyalist trade guilds and the feared Dockside Internal Security Directorate (DISD).
