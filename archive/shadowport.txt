[b][color=#4FA8C7]Overview[/color][/b]:  
Forged from the fog and neon of the Twilight Seas, [b]Shadowport[/b] is a maritime confederation of free states bound by trade, secrecy, and innovation. Its fleets dominate the archipelagos of the Karzstov cluster, serving as crossroads for smugglers, traders, and pioneers of the new world. Guided by the [i]Dockside Charter[/i], the region prizes independence, creativity, and quiet power over empire.
