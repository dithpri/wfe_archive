[b]CAPTURED: 10/1/20

This region femdom and sexist used to be a holding of [nation]Eternal Cesken[/nation] until EC and the ex founder puppet let this region CTE. But that&#39;s not the only thing, this region used to be a holding of [region]The Black Hawks[/region] who raided and locked [region]SECFanatics[/region] our former embassies so that is like extra topping on pizza. This region will serve as a triple capture (a capture from radical feminists, [region]The Black Hawks[/region], and [nation]Eternal Cesken[/nation])[/b]
