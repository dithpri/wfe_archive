From the dawn of creation we have held the Traditional Lands of Progressive Earth, and since that time our neighbors have looked upon us with jealous eyes. From the Disciples of the Mathematician Merlin, to the United People of the Polystates we have fought long and numerous wars to support our independence. Yet none are so terrible as the Nomads of Theseria. For thousands of years the light of civilization clashed with darkness of barbarism in a malestrom of violence. Border states and the lives of our citizens were exchanged in a seemingly ending series of wars. For all this time we held them back, yet in our darkest hour their forces were too great for us to handle. Driven from our homes, this was the beginning of the Exodus.
