New CyberPastery International (NCPI) is a global market for bake goods such as cinnamon rolls, bread, and even cakes. Our private military can also be hired in war times but WA officials aren&#39;t supposed to know that.
The NCPI is a free flow nation for embassies and an RMB purely for discussion for other nations. Bakery goods are also bought and sold here with a market for any goods not bakery related, all bakery items are under New CyberPastery goods and any bakery goods not associated with the New CyberPastery brand will be destroyed and anyone involved will be prosecuted under NCPI jurisdiction.

NCPI is owned and operated by New Cybercity.

Enjoy your time!
