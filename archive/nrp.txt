[b][color=blue] [u]The Region of NRP[/u][/b][/color]

The region of NRP is a deeply divided collection of nations located upon a central continent as well as various other surrounding islands. Currently, the region is accepting inter-regional embassies and encouraging international diplomacy in general. Moreover, as more volcanoes in the region erupt, new islands are constantly being formed and thus used as a base for nationstates pending membership to the region.
