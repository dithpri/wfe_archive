The year is 2060.
Earth is running out of resources to maintain it&#146;s ever growing population that is also simultaneously aging. Meanwhile, a breakthrough was achieved as scientists created a direct fusion engine that allows humans to travel to other planets in mere months, not years.

What will happen next depends on you.
