[i]A fundamentally broken world gone mad. 

Superpowers bleed from a nuclear exchange a decade prior. 
Mass proliferation of digital technologies such as cybernetic implants, sapient AI, and the Third Internet Revolution. 
Exploitation of natural resources across the Global South is booming. 
Those in control find ways to surveil and monitor the populace with harsh scrutiny.

Hope is not lost for some.
In pockets and corners of the world, the wild and free have planted flags, raised guns, and drawn borders.

Still others search for the truth in the insanity, uncovering the secrets of where it all went wrong.

What will you make of it?[/i]
