Vogeland is mostly taiga, with patches of desert, as well as rainforests along the southern coast. This country of countries has free trade, and a secret service called the Volgish Inquiry. Currently at war with Chechestan, but no one really cares enough to actually launch an attack, while our leaders are laughing in the background. Vogeland engages in democratic elections to determine its prime minister and motivations.
