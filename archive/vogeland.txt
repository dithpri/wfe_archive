Vogeland is a large, beautiful nation with a diverse climate, random exclusion zones(thanks to Dazz Bixs making it so easy to get atomic bombs) and so many chickens, it makes Haleiwa look like a barren wasteland. The six states of Vogeland are bound by a common interest in social welfare, with some preferring the Nordic model, while others resort to socialism. Well except for Stephanation. No idea what&#146;s going on there. Mostly governed by two powers. Democratic socialist Ann Arborr, and Social Democratic Purple Space. Currently at war with Central Mandaeia, but its been at a ceasefire for a while. The war still is active in the form of espionage, and making smaller countries go to war against each other.
