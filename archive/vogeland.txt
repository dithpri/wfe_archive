Vogeland is a large, beautiful nation with a diverse climate, random exclusion zones(thanks to Dazz Bixs making it so easy to get atomic bombs) and so many chickens, it makes Haleiwa look like a barren wasteland.There are currently three major political parties in Vogeland, Socialist, liberal, and conservative. Mostly governed by two powers. Democratic socialist Ann Arborr, and Social Democratic Purple Space, with Nivishland growing in influence. Currently at war with Central Mandaeia, but its been at a ceasefire for a while. The war still is active in the form of espionage, and making smaller countries go to war against each other.
