[b][color=#000061]Derp! Derp! Derp! This region [i]literally[/i] proved no challenge for the metaphorical equivalent of sandcastle-stomping by [region=The Black Riders]![/color]

Childishly vandalised by The Beige Riders! Our lair can be found in a primary school playground near you!

Into the weird, pointless, easily-reversed button-clicking session in a region with an active founder sauntered the following plonkers:
[nation=short]General Halcones[/nation]
[nation=short]Aurum Rider[/nation]
[nation=short]Lord Nuke[/nation]

Congratulations each one of you for a hard-fought battle against a vacuum![/b]
