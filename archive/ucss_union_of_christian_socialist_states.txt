The UCSS or Union of Christian Socialist States, is a coalition of Christian nations who wish to provide safety and security and support the rights of all nations regardless of creed, race, or religion. The UCSS is not a communist union, it is a semi-conservative union of like minded nations who simply wish to create a region where Christian nations can facilitate diplomatic negotiations with their neighbors and carry on the mission of spreading good works and deeds and follow in the footsteps of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ by living and doing his work on earth.
