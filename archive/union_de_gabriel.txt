[b]This region was taken over by [region]Lily[/region], so it was occupied by the organization [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=germantica/detail=factbook/id=463290]Military Alliance Coalition[/url], marking the first regional occupation by MAC. If the founder so chooses they can take back the region, but we are briefly taking over so this region is not raided by Lily or similar organizations once more. The region shall bear our flag as a marker, but if the founder returns to activity then they can remove it. Think of this as us keeping the region nice and safe for you, [nation]Cheiso Spana[/nation].
