We are located in a massive pocket galaxy at the far corner of the universe. A very long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. Away from the meddling mundane and petty affairs of the Star Wars Galaxy and the pathetic Milky Way Galaxy with those Earthbound humans. Here we practice Imperial culture and traditions and Sith ways and philosophy centred around a deep love and commitment to the Dark Side of the Force. For a safe and secure society. Keeping the peace in all the known galaxies with overwhelming destructive power if the Imperial military machine!
