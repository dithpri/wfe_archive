Unregion was founded for the purpose of being a region of peace, freedom and intellect; prepared to consider systems atypical of those traditionally enforced elsewhere.
To help one, to help all; minimal harm; working to live transparently up to ideals, rather than hiding falsely behind them.
Family is more than blood; nation is more than bloodline; truth is more than dogma; reality is more than a belief. Knowledge is a power, truth is a foundation, to be shared with our family in our nation. To choose us is to be us.
