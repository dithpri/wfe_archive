Originally founded 2003 became one of the more prolific invaders that ever graced the Realm of Nationstates. Famously taking Mercia, Evility, Abbey Road to name a few. Naturally this drew the attention of the prominent defenders worldwide and our task to spoil people&amp;#39;s regions for no good reason became pretty much insurmountable. We had our own forum which no longer exists but towards 2005, the landscape of NS changed so much so Invading was virtually outlawed and the ensuing years led to a gradual demise

However 2015 I am back, we need new blood, old heads and soldiers with know how to successfully invade as I intend to make Blue Moon great once more
