A region for Christian states to prosper and continue to spread the good news; Jesus Christ is the only begotten Son of God. He was Conceived by the Holy Spirit with the Holy Blessed Virgin Mary. He was Crucified, Died and was Buried for our sins and Rose Again from the dead on the Third Day in accordance with God&#39;s Holy Will. May the Holy Peace of God be with you always!
