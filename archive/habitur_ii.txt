Habitur is a Cascadian planet near Sol. Originally, the main super-powers on the planet were Alexonia and Justonia in ancient times, but eventually fell. The region was occupied by a few small unrecognized nations. It remained this way for a century, until Justinmark united these countries into Alexonia II. The government lasted being the superpower in the region until the formation of Morrowmir to the West. Eventually, a Morrowmir plot caused the fall of Alexonia II, once again separating the region. Eventually, the rebel groups and factions joined together to form The Holy Land of Alexonia, based off of the Alexonian Church, the major religion in the region
