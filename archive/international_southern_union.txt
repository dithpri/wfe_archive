[color=blue]The purpose of this region is to grow in number and set up a functional, regional government with democracy, where every nation has a say in the success of this region. And once we hit a goal of 40 nations, we will become joint in government with the IWU.
We hope you&amp;#39;ll stay and support our development![/color]
