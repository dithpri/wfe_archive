[color=orange][b][u]Welcome![/color][/b][/u]

[color=blue]This is the ISU, a newly founded sister region to:
~[region]International Northern Union[/region]~
~[region]International Arctic Union[/region]~
And the mother region, ~[region]International Western Union[/region]~[/color]
[hr]
[color=blue]The purpose of this region is to grow in number and set up a functional, democratic government where every nation has a say in the success of this region. And once we hit a goal of 40 nations, we will combine governments with the IWU, IAU, and INU.
We hope you&amp;#39;ll stay and support our development![/color]
[color=orange][b]If you feel the need to discuss mature content or use swear words, please refrain yourself. We wish to keep this region open for all ages.[/color][/b]
