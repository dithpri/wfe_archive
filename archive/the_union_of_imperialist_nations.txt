Welcome to the Union of Imperialist Nations! This place is constantly changing between frontier and region. Nothing here is final in terms of administration and governance. The whole region is still in it&#39;s construction phase. I (Hiloooooo) have been trying to make it something nice. I still can&#39;t decide on many things, and it is harder now without Nova Scoti (Co-founder/second in command and old WA delegate) has left.
