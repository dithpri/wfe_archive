The Union is like a Phoenix, it never dies, it just comes back, and we aren&#39;t mad about it. Nova Scoti has returned home, and is now WA delegate, as they were before, in 2023. Now, The Union is back to it&#39;s former glory. It has been a long and hard time without Nova Scoti. Union of Imperialist Nations forever!
