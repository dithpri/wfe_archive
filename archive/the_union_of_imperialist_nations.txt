I have failed this region, I have failed you, I have failed everyone who is and was here. My apologies, I am done trying to get a dead man to come back, I am done trying to help, because I can&#39;t nor want to anymore. This is all my fault, my debt to all of you is infinite. Yet, I still cannot bring myself to leave this place, if you want an active community, go somewhere else. I am making this place a frontier, in one last desperate bid to make the community active. This plan will fail like all the others.
