The Empire proper and all conquered territories span thousands of systems, exoplanets, and large swathes of Imperial held territory on disputed worlds. It&amp;#39;s many varied people live in varying states of technological advancement, except the core Reavic worlds, and those well kept by the Immortals who stand vigil over their fiefdoms. It owes it&amp;#39;s allegiances solely to the Twin Goddesses of Reavic Lore, and Her chosen representative, the Emperor(ess) of Reavani.
