Welcome y&#146;all; the Flying Fishes Bait Shop is here for whatever you need for a relaxing day on the trails or water....and so much more!

The Bait Shop is nestled amongst many nationstates lakes and marshes.  Visit the Bait Shop to buy tackle, waders, or live bait; rent a boat, get some cornbread from the lunch counter, hear the weekly fishing report, and most importantly listen to (and tell) amazing fish tales!

Explore the many hiking trails surrounding the lakes.  Stay at the campground.  Take a swim from the pier.  Be thrilled by the many interesting denizens that populate the waters and surrounding woods!

Southern hospitality applies here in the Bait Shop, so remember to have fun and check out the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=mermaids_of_the_bayou/detail=factbook/id=main] map [/url]!
