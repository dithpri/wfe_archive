Italy is now in the hands of the people. Please endorse [nation]Knoll[/nation] so that the region can recover from the recent struggles. When [nation=short]Knoll[/nation] is elected a solid form of government will be established. A democratic government. This region will be a free beacon of prosperity once again. We apologize for the chaos that has played out in the last two days.
