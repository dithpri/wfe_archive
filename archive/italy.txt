The people of [region]Italy[/region] have decided that a new government shall be founded. A new tasteful blend of the House of Savoy monarchy and the Italian Republic constitutional monarchy. A new constitution will be drafted on January 7th in a thread on the regional forum. Please join if you wish to help. The former government will be in state temporarily until the new constitution is ratified. President [nation=short]Knoll[/nation] apologizes for drafting the previous document and looks forward to assisting in the drafting of the new document.
