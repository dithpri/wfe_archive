Welcome to Italy, it is very Boot Shaped here, and one of our cites is a bit moist.

the Hippo is Known for both being Big and French, Whereas the Aardvark is much more Italian.
The Aardvark is fond of eating Ants and Benito Mussolini.

The Aardvark is our regional Animal.
we should all strive to be more like the Noble Aardvark.

When Life gives you lemons, thou shut up and eat your darn Lemons.
