[b]We are the [i]Sons of Marx[/i], a commune devoted to the understanding, application, further development and embodiment of Marxian Socialism, better known as Communism.

We reject the totalitarianism of the 20th century, but acknowledge the important issues raised, directly or indirectly, by Marxism&amp;#39;s revisions, such as Maoism, Stalinism, the Juche Ideal and Titoism. While lessons can be drawn from such, the final product can only be the original, Marxist conception of Communism.
