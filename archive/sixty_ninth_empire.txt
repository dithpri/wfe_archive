Welcome to Sixty-Ninth Empire, where fascism is verboten, but tall leather boots and riding crops are absolutely encouraged!

Sixty-Ninth Empire is a wonderful land where a smorgasbord of humans, transhumans, posthumans, and nonhumans enjoy fulfilling relationships with one another while engaging in joyous labor that fosters self-actualization. Also, the music scene is really good, and the artisanal burger restaurants, taco trucks, and panipuri carts are to die for. Enjoy some currywurst and doner kebab with a cute shark or extraterrestrial alien or robot or whatever!
