[region]The Walbard Union[/region] was founded in 2006 as the Federal Republic of &amp;quot;Walbard Union&amp;quot;.

TWU was founded on the 18th of February 2006, four days before the founder&amp;#39;s birthday.

Our region was renamed to The Walbard Union in 2008, where we reached our height of 150+ nations.

After an espionage plot brought down our democracy in 2009, we converted to imperialism.

This region is now the sole property of [region]The Walbard Republic[/region].
