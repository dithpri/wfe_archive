The Walbard Union was founded in 2009 after a Civil War between Royalists and Democrats.

This page continues as a legacy towards the efforts of past, present and future Walbardians.

TWU hosted 2x Inter-Regional Summits + a Union of Crowns with Denmark.

Since then, our region has been known many different names and government types.

Our region has moved to [b][region]Walbard[/region][/b], why not move with us?

[nation=short]WALBARD[/nation] needs you there!
