[color=#CD0000]&amp;#9773;[B]Workers of the World, Unite![/b]&amp;#9773;

We welcome comrades to our humble region, the Workers Democratic Union!
[i]The Workers Democratic Union is a Socialist Assembly of Left-Wing Nations, Our Values Include Nationalisation, Social Liberalism, Democracy and Peace[/i]

[i][b]Is there aught we hold in common with the greedy parasite
Who would lash us into serfdom and would crush us with his might?
Is there anything left to us but to organize and fight?
For the union makes us strong![/i][/b]

Stay and Enjoy.
