Formerly part of [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=orientopia]Orientopia[/url], Miauslavia is home to 4 nations, all with non-human populations. Member states have adopted a form of communism called Animalism which states, among other things, that &amp;quot;whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend&amp;quot;. The official languages in Miauslavia are Russian and Ukrainian.
