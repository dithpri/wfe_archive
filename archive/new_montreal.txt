A very busy region!Come here to make an impact on a small region. You can be a puppet nation (second nation of one person) or not! Currently we have a reporter for the New Antarctica Globe, so we get the Globe, if there is an issue. If you want to establish an embassy with us, we will accept unless you threaten to raid us or our allies. Plus, we do RP on the message board, no forums needed. If you are WA, PLEASE ENDORSE [nation]Lisastia[/nation]! [region]Nationstates[/region], stop turning down our embassy requests.
