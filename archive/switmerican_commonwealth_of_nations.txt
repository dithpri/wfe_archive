The Switmerican Commonwealth of Nations, normally known as the Commonwealth, is a political association of 3 member states, all of them being in free association with the Federal Republic of Switmerica. The Commonwealth dates back to the first half of 2018 when it was originally created through the Bronlinton Declaration at the 2018 Commonwealth Conference, and established the member states as &quot;being in free association&quot;.
