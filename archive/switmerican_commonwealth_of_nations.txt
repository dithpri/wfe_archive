The Switmerican Commonwealth of Nations, normally known as the Commonwealth, is a political association of member states who are in free association with the Federal Republic of Switmerica. The Commonwealth dates back to the first half of 2018 when it was originally created through the Bronlinton Declaration at the 2018 Commonwealth Conference, and established the member states as &quot;being in free association&quot;.

The human symbol of this free association is the Head of the Switmerican Commonwealth, currently Prime Minister Peter Kar, and is always held by the Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Switmerica.
