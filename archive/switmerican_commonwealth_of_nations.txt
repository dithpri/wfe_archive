The [b]Switmerican Commonwealth of Nations[/b], normally known as the Commonwealth, is a political association of 4 member states, all of them being in free association with the Federal Republic of Switmerica. The Commonwealth dates back to the first half of 2018 when it was originally created through the Bronlinton Declaration at the 2018 Commonwealth Conference, and established the member states as &quot;being in free association&quot;.

Member states agree to confer upon citizens of member states any similar right or privilege that a citizen might possess in their country of origin, grant precedence to citizens in matters of customs, immigration, and enquiries, as well as provide consular assistance for each other in all other foreign states.
