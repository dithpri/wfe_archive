The [b][color=green]Switmerican Commonwealth of Nations[/color][/b] is an intergovernmental organisation of member states that are mostly in free association with the [b]Federal Republic of [nation]Switmerica[/nation][/b].

The Commonwealth dates back to 30 November 2018, when it was created through the Bronlinton Declaration at the 2018 Commonwealth Conference, and established the member states as being &quot;in free association with the Federal Republic of Switmerica&quot;. The symbol of this free association is the Blue Ensign, which features the flag of Switmerica in its canton.
