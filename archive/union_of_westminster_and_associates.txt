The Union of Westminster and Associates is for private members whom attend Westminster Christian Academy, or have been given permission by someone already in the group to join. We are focused on giving people political and civil rights, just not to many freedoms as this can lead to anarchy. We also look towards a strong economy to help us maintain a global ranking as one of the best regions in the entire world.
