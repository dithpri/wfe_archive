Like the scripture says

Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree

And no one shall make them afraid

They&#39;ll be safe in the nation we&#39;ve made

I wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree

A moment alone in the shade

At home in this nation we&#39;ve made

One last time
