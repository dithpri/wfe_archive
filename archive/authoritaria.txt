[b]Some foodie folks from [region]The Black Hawks[/region] were hungry so decided to create a [color=Orangered]Delicious Hotpot[/color]. Some friends joined as well after hearing about it. We pillaged your region for some of the well needed supplies for our culinary masterpiece. We are really excited to see what the end product is! We left some decorations in gratitude for providing us supplies![/b]

[color=3CB371][i][b]Perhaps you may want to have a taste of our hotpot. Well if you [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]contact us[/url], you can! Maybe even help make the next one.[/b][/i][/color]
