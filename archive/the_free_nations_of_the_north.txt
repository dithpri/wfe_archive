[color=red]Hello. We are the Free Nations of the North, or the FNN for short; We mostly RP and talk.
 We don&#39;t have silly rules like endorsement capacities and things like that! However, we [i]do[/i] have a constitution on what must be legalized in your nation, and what must be criminalized.[/color]

[color=Blue]Check out the pinned dispatches! We tend to let them do the talking since they will help in your involvement in the FNN, and will give you tips![/color]
