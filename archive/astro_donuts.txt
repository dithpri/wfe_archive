Smart in all types of areas, we work together well, and are capable of developing new ideas. These are just some of the many accomplishments and qualities of this democratic region. We work as a team, not as separate nations, but together as one.

We defeat our enemies, trust our allies, and become a nation as one. We build and influence each other, not as a town, not as a nation, but as a region.
