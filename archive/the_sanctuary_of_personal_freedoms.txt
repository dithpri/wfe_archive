I as a nation dream of a place which can be seen as a calm diplomatic &quot;heaven&quot;. I dream for a place which 1000&#39;s can be joint in harmony. I dream of a place where your race, gender, species, will not be judged or used against you. I dream of a place that you feel like you&#39;re in harmony. This place I dream for is Sanctuary. (Raiders beware)
