Oh no! There seems to have been a grave error in the calculations of the defenders, resulting in them marking [region]New Alotania[/region] as do-not-defend, rather than its embassy [region]Global Coalition for Humanity[/region]. Luckily, I happen to be a math nerd, and was able to correct their calculations. If you want to raid an actually problematic region, please move to [region]Global Coalition for Humanity[/region] and telegram me, I&#39;ll endorse you.

[i][b]Surely the super late update time of New Alotania and the super early update time of Global Coalition for Humanity are just a coincidence?[/b][/i]
