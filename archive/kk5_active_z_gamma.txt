We Will Be Using It For Testing Puppets.[/color]

[color=663310]Just a note to recruiters from [nation=short]RHW[/nation] and company -[/color][color=FF6010]
[list][hr]We apply this rule to all of our puppets:  If you use &amp;quot;External&amp;quot; telegrams to recruit by, 
to bypass normal recruiting filters, you should expect to be blocked from future communications, 
and your message to be totally ignored. Just wasting your time and resources, in the end. 
Defeating your cause, as well.[hr][/color][color=663310][/list][/color][color=339933]
