The beauty of Upsadinia is that it is placed on the Hearth of the planet Fuga. The atmosphere on Planet Fuga allows almost everything to fly or glide; its gravity is strong enough to keep its being on the planet yet light enough that even elephants can glide from the mountain top down to the valley. A lot of species and animals have some form of wings that allow them to either fly or glide. Sometimes, it can be deadly because flying snakes are light enough to glide around and use the cold and hot fronts in the atmosphere to fly from one end of the planet to another end.
