Neov is a circular continent with several nations, each of the same relative size and shape. For centuries, its nations have been at uneasy peace thanks to the Treaty of Neov, which marked the end of the Neov Civil War, splitting the former gargantuan state of Neov into several smaller nations bearing similar names. Each of these nations were formerly factions of the Neov Civil War which sought to have different types of government. While each of the Neov states are run by differing forms of government, they all speak a common language (albeit with slightly varying dialects) and permit traffic between their borders.
