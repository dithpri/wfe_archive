This is the Kang Chiao Intrnational School East China Campus official region.
It contains only students with a passion for learning more about civics. These students will enter into our region as little entry level politicians and leave as fully fledged Nation owning butterflies!

This is a place for learning and developing that true feeling of owning a country by yourself. 

It was founded in 2020 on the 21st of the 5th month.
