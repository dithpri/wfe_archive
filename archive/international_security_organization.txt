The [b]International Security Organization[/b] is an intergovernmental organization that seeks to promote defense and economic cooperation between region members. Our organization is strongly committed to multilateralism, and wishes to further the welfare of its members and the international community at large. We are still in our formative stages, and quite small, so matters of official policy are open to change by new members. Please contact the Universal Union of [nation=short+noflag]the Transhuman Combine[/nation] with any questions or concerns you may have, and we will respond to you promptly and to the best of our ability.
