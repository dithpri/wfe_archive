I&#39;m creating this region as a laid-back space for NationStates users, both new and old, to discuss whatever they deem to be of interest. I reserve the right to administer the region at my discretion, but will attempt to be as un-intrusive as possible. We may adopt official positions on various issues, or begin conducting either internal or external policy activities at some point, but I do not foresee these being particularly extensive. I personally enjoy discussing matters pertaining to modern military equipment, foreign relations, economics, video games, and history. If you feel the same way, or want to learn more about these subjects, please feel free to join my region.
