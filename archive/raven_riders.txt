The raven riders are a free spirited group based mainly on logic and what the individual believes to be right for themselves. And while government is involved we believe that they should be there to support the people instead of lock them all in a big box with no toys called a nation.

If you like to get out and have fun the Raven riders are the group for you!

Nothing can be achieved without trying. Nothing can be won without learning from your losses. Nothing can be taught, without you learning that lesson first..
