The Imperial Isles region gets it&#39;s name from the Empire of Estris, which is in full control of the region and all the colonies and nation&#39;s that reside. However they will have their own goverments. The Empire and it&#39;s colonies will come to the aid of any other region that is underthreat of being invaded. In return that attacked region will help The Empire attack and take over the offending region. The Empire is honour bound to never invade unless provoked. 

The region is an RP region and takes inspiration from the Order of the Grey Wardens region which I am an ex member of, the only difference is we will take over regions and expand the Empire.
