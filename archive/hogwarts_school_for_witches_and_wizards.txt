The [region]Hogwarts School for Witches and Wizards[/region] will have you take a test to see what Hogwarts house you are in. [color=green]Slytherin,[/color] [color=red]Gryffindor,[/color] [color=blue]Ravenclaw,[/color] or [color=yellow]Hufflepuff.[/color] If you already know then telegram [nation]Panda Party[/nation]. If not then take the quiz in the dispatch below. If you have no idea what Hogwarts is, then I will tell you that it is a school for Witches and Wizards. If you do not want to take the quiz, then don&#39;t, but it is highly recommended. It will let you participate in the Quidditch Cup!
