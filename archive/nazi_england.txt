[b][u][color=blue]Operation Sad Nazis:[/color][/b][/u]

[color=red]This region was originally smashed by The MT Army during our golden era (2004-2006), it was let go between 2008/9, no longer having relevance to the modern game play.

Nazis, 4-5 years later, desperate for any &amp;quot;win&amp;quot; they could get against us, refounded it as a fake victory.[/color]

This was the first fascist region captured by [region]The MT Army[/region]! It was been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in the name of [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascism[/b].
