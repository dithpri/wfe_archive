The White Rose was an underground nonviolent student resistance group against Hitler and the Nazis, famous for their leaflet campaigns. It originally consisted of five students who were initially joined together by their love for literature, philosophy, theology, and science: Hans and Sophie Scholl, Christoph Probst, Alexander Schmorell and Willi Graf. All died on the guillotine in 1943, but their ideas live on.

Refounded 5/31/2010 In Remembrance to all who lost their lives at the hands of hitler and the nazis.
