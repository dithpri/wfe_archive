The Autonomist Antifa movement, or anti&#150;fascism, opposes the domination of subaltern or marginalized peoples. Autonomism is anti&#150;authoritarian communism. The Antifa Luxemburgist Communist Collective&#153; (ALCC&#153;) or Antifa Luxemburgism&#153;, as a unifying agent of left regroupment, remains nonviolent and nonconfrontational. Its practices are protective and defensive, never aggressive and offensive. Regarding left refoundation, ALCC&#146;s primary critical frameworks are [url=http://markfoster.red]Marxism&#150;Luxemburgism[/url] and [url=http://markfoster.space]Bhaskarian critical realism[/url].
