Its practices are protective and defensive, never aggressive and offensive. When events wannant, activists may, as an illustration, escourt intended victims to safe areas. Regarding left refoundation, ALCC&#146;s primary critical frameworks are Marxism&#150;Luxemburgism and Bhaskarian critical realism.
