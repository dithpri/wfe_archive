The Autonomist Antifa movement, or anti&#150;fascism, opposes the domination of subaltern or marginalized peoples. Autonomism is anti&#150;authoritarian communism. The Antifa Luxemburgist Communist Collective&#153; (ALCC&#153;) or Antifa Luxemburgism&#153;&#151;as a unifying agent of left regroupment&#151;remains nonviolent. Its practices are protective and defensive, never aggressive and offensive. With left refoundation, ALCC relies upon [url=http://markfoster.red]Marxism&#150;Luxemburgism[/url], [url=http://markfoster.space]Bhaskarian critical realism[/url], and [url=http://www.markfoster.net/antifa/intersectionality.pdf]intersectionality[/url].
