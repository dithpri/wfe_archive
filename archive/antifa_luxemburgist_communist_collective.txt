The Autonomist Antifa movement, or antifascism, opposes the domination of subaltern or marginalized peoples. Autonomism is anti&#150;authoritarian communism. The Antifa Luxemburgist Communist Collective&#153; (ALCC&#153;) or Antifa Luxemburgism&#153;&#151;as a unifying agent of left regroupment&#151;engages in protection and defense, [i]never[/i] aggression and offense. ALCC&#146;s left refoundation is based upon [url=http://markfoster.red/]Marxist&#150;Luxemburgist libertarian communism[/url] and uses [url=http://markfoster.space/]Bhaskarian critical realism[/url] as metatheory with [url=http://www.markfoster.net/antifa/intersectionality.pdf]intersectionality[/url] and world&#150;systems analysis as key critical frameworks.
