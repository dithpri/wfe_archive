Welcome to [b][color=red]Valendis[/color][/b]!

[nation]Genseria[/nation] is currently admin of Valendis, in case a WA delegate gets elected/appointed or whatever it is delegates do, executive authority can be transfered to the aforementioned. 

There isn&#39;t much of a gameplay or rules since the only reason this region exists is so that [nation]Vasaras[/nation] could acquire the [i]&#39;Brave New World&#39;[/i] achievement. The Kingdom of Vasaras itself is not part of the region, but a skulking around in [region]Eientei Gensokyo[/region].
