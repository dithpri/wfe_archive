[b]Welcome to BACIN NINE NINE! The umpteenth effort of Several Friends to Create a Successfully operating Democratic Region. Here we firmly believe in freedom of speech and in the processes of a Federal Democracy. The Chancellor is elected by the people every month, who also elect senators. The Senate serves as the restraining body for the Chancellor. They have the power to veto his motions but only in unanimity. [/b]
