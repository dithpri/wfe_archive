[b]Welcome to [region]BACIN NINE NINE[/region]! The umpteenth effort of several friends to create a successfully operating democratic region. In this region we firmly believe in freedom of speech and in the processes of a federal democracy. The chancellor is elected by the people every month. There is also a supreme court to act as the chancellor&#39;s restraining body and they rule on legal decisions. Additionally there is a security agency named BAILS to protect the people headed by the Attorney General [/b]
