The mysterious &quot;Black and White&quot; spirit, Hei Bai, is said to live in this region. Visiting villages at night, the spirit blesses those good to the environment, and curses those who destroy it&#39;s home. Some speculate that the feared Hei Bai&#39;s curse drags it&#39;s victims to the spirit world to wander around aimlessly for eternity.
