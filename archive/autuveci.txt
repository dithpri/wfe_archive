The [b][i]People&#39;s Socialist Confederation of Autuveci[/i][/b] (PSCA) is a communist region of socialist republics, free unions, workers&#39; councils, eco-municipalities, and other autonomous communities.

The PSCA governs itself through the process of democratic centralism and finds principled theoretical and tactical unity through:

&amp;#9733; Self-determination and self-reliance
&amp;#9733; Industrial democracy and the dictatorship of the proletariat
&amp;#9733; Antifascism and internationalism
&amp;#9733; Historical and dialectical materialism
&amp;#9733; Collective responsibility and social ecology

We are committed to building socialism and working class democracy by fighting for the emancipation of all by all.
