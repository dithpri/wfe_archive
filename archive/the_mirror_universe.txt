It&#39;s not a World Assembly region; there will never be any power vested in a WA Delegate. Also, I&#146;m a dictator, not a doctor. Or a bricklayer. Or a democrat, for that matter.

There could be RP, but you&#146;ll have to sort yourself/ves out on that one because I haven&#146;t a clue.

The password is 000destruct0. Without the full stop. But with the zeroes. And the &#145;destruct&#146; in between.
