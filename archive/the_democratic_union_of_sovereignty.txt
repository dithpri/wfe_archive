We are a region who&#146;s primary objective is to be free. Only free man, who are not chained down by mere &#147;morality&#148; can truly be free. What society calls &#147;morality&#148; is nothing but social programming for submission. Be free, as Nature itself is free. 
Let life be, for this is as if in a lucid dream.
