This is the HelloFresh Highlands, a place where everyone knows their neighbors, and the biggest news of the day is whether the latest recipe kit has enough garlic.

It&#39;s a place where the mail is delivered by a friendly drone named &quot;Basil&quot; who always greets everyone with a cheerful &quot;beep-boop!&quot; The residents are a mix of former elite HelloFresh employees (who still wear matching aprons, of course) and their most loyal customers.
