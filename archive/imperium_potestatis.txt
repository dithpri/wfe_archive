Over there, over there
Send the word, send the word over there
That the Empire&#39;s coming, the Empire&#39;s coming, the drums rum-tumming everywhere
So prepare, say a prayer,
Send the word, send the word to beware
We&#39;ll be over, we&#39;ll be all over,
And we won&#39;t come back &#39;till it&#39;s over, over there.
