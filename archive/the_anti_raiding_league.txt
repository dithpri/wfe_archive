The Anti Raiding League is a civilian army. We have members from:

[region]Chicken Overlords[/region], [region]Anti Fairy Pact[/region], [region]Red Fox Pact[/region], [region]India[/region], [region]URA[/region] (unofficially), [region]Anti Lily[/region], [region]the Monarchy Alliance[/region], [region]Arvadia[/region], [region]the Snakes[/region] and [region]Laraniem[/region]! 

We have participated in 1 operation as of today (successful defense of [region]Boston[/region], however this was led by Libcord and Libcord contributed like 50 times more than us lol). 2 other liberations were planned but never happened for reasons.
