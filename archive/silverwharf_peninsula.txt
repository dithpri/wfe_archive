Wreathed by raging seas and great serpents, this lawless archipelago is deemed by some as a land of opportunity, an island paradise where appetite is all that limits the individual. Each kingdom and nation that inhabits the islands is diverse but all share in trade and travel. Many are lawless or entirely despotic. This verdant region controls no one, and is controlled only by nature.
