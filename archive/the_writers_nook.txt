We are a collaborative writing project and Nation RP group, and you are invited to join us in our region and Discord server (where we do most of our RP and writing).

Dirth is a fictional world with real world technology of the year 2000. Similarly, the RP encourages nations to assess their positions among their neighbors and in the global community, during an era where technologies like the internet truly take hold in the world.

Our RP is just getting started, so feel free to join and make your mark on the beginning of our story.
All are welcome into our RP, be they new or experienced.
We encourage all inquiries to go in our Discord server to one of our admins.
