We are the nations that exist lost in time; many worship the gods, both old and new, yet all marvel at the great machinery and technological advancement that our unions bring.
All nations in this union are required to have a Celtic or Nordic flag, although alterations and changes are allowed (symbols, extra crosses etc).
This is a refuge for all rugged nations that have not forgotten the tales of our great fathers that fought the empires and rebelled against invasion.
We hope to use our guiding light to create an intelligent utopia that can both worship the unknown and investigate it.
Welcome all brothers! Feast!
