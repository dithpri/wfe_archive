We rose from the ashes of our collapsed homelands, to beat out political correctness and anything remotely right. Our citizens have given endless praise to our brainwashing, public execution, and awesome marching bands that accompany our epic marches down the main street, with soldiers in perfect formation to the tune of 80s music (they do a mean ABBA tribute). But take it from us, when you are under our wing we will make your economies as strong as gods so they could knock out Hercules.
(Note: Niceness not included. often political meetings end in murdering a few diplomats from other civilised regions here and there.)
