Region name ie based off a fictional series of books that I enjoy, Spice and Wolf (One of the major cities)

Now, let&amp;#39;s get on with a description of the region.

The area ranges from the far north to halfway between the north pole and the equator. The climate for most areas is relatively cold. In the more southern areas, most revenue is made off of agricultural exports to foreign countries, as well as to the northern parts of the region where it is processed. The North is partially agricultural, but makes a lot of revenue off of processing goods, as well as things like spices and meat. Clothing is also a popular export of the more Northern parts of the region. The region is somewhat isolated from other regions of the world as well.
