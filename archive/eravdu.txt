Eravdu is a unique fantasy world ruled by scholars and waterclock technology. Everything in the corporeal realm has a corresponding complex equation in the incorporeal realm, and when the variables in these equations are altered, humanity can perform supernatural feats known as magic and miracles! Due to the nature of magic and miracles being fundamentally tied to alchemy and mathematics, this is a world ruled by scholars where schools and universities rather than families rule over nations and empires. Through the fusion of magic and technology, inventors have created waterclock-based engines that power everything in this world from waterjet swords to flying machines.
