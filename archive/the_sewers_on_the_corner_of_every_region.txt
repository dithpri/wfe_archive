[color=brown][b]Welcome to the Sewers on the Corner of Every Region![/b][/color]
[hr]

[color=black]The dank, [b]dark,[/b] and above all [i]noxious[/i] underground labyrinth[/color] [color=grey]
of pipes, sewers, and underground rivers fed by [b]everything[/b][/color] [color=darkgreen]
that is [b]washed[/b] or [b]flushed[/b] down the [b]waste water[/b] pipes,[/color] [color=green]gutters, and drains of [b]every connected embassy region...[/b][/color]

[color=aubergine]Yes, we know where [b]all[/b] the [b]bodies[/b] are, but please don&#39;t ask us[/color] [color=darkgreen]about any property [b]lost[/b] down here, because the &#39;waters&#39;, such[/color] [color=green]as they are, have a habit of changing things...[/color]

[color=green]We have enough trouble with the crocodiles, alligators,[/color] [color=darkgreen]humanoid flukeworms, and that infamous [b]man-sized rat sensei[/b][/color] [color=aubergine]and his troupe of [b]pizza-loving ninja turtles,[/b] to be bothered[/color] [color=green]about that[/color] [color=gold][b]Rolex&#153;[/b][/color] [color=green] that you insist was yours, but looks [b]very[/color] [color=darkgreen]much better on [u]our[/u] wrists, thank you.[/b][/color]
