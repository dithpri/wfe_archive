Welcome to the Sewers on the Corner of Every Region!

The dank, dark, and above all noxious underground labyrinth of pipes, sewers, and underground rivers fed by [b]everything[/b] that is washed or flushed down the waste water pipes, gutters, and drains of every connected embassy region...

Yes, we know where all the bodies are, but please don&#39;t ask us about any property lost down here, because the &#39;waters&#39;, such as they are, have a habit of changing things...

We have enough trouble with the crocodiles, alligators, humanoid flukeworms, and that infamous man-sized rat sensei and his troupe of pizza-loving ninja turtles, to be bothered about that Rolex you insist was yours, but looks very nice on our wrists, thank you.
