We&#39;re the reincarnation of a region founded nearly half a decade ago by [nation]Arlum[/nation].
[color=red]We have a regional government, and elections are held on the first of every month.[/color]
[color=grey](Note: We are currently running under the Windrose Act until further notice while we set up our new regional government.)[/color]
For all new nations, don&#39;t be shy! Go and say hello on the regional chat. We&#39;re happy to have you with us.
