[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] went out on a flight to some thrifts shops to buy some parts for their rockets. The rocket was assembled, but unfortunately didn&#39;t get very far as it crashed landed here. They found some parts laying around here to fix their ship, then zoomed back to [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]the nest[/url].[/b]
