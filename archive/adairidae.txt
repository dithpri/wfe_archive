I spammed a few letters and made a nice(ish) name.

Endorse [nation]Glycerias[/nation], the World Assembly Delegate, if you want the region to transform from a Frontier to a Stronghold!
Once a small group of nations with the region on the brink of extinction, [nation]Glycerias[/nation] took over, removed the password and made the region alive again!
You would not be here if it was not for [nation]Glycerias[/nation].
Before [nation]I like death[/nation] ceases to exist, and therefore his endorsement also ceases to exist, if you are in the World Assembly please endorse [nation]Glycerias[/nation]!
