This region is one for anarchists around the world to come and enjoy a completely lawless land, in which we will work against restrictions on anyone altogether. Here there is no government, and all nations may do WHATEVER THEY WANT to do!!!!! No disciplinary action will be taken against any nations for any decisions they make in their nation.

It is not mandatory for any nation in the world assembly who comes here to endorse their current delegate.

[b]All who want an end to government, laws, and oppressive rulers and wish for a purely lawless land, come and rally in the grand region of [color=red]Complete Madness[/color]![/b]
