We are descendants from the people of Insula de Scientia et de libertate. We were among those who crashed on the moon of Jupiter and helped colonize. However, things changed and the nation Post-Europa was formed. We disagreed, and demanded for 3 transport ships to leave. Things went well and Academicus II gave us what we wanted, but then we could not agree on the type of government. We decided to give each cultures a ship. All new colonies made a deal with Post-Europa to keep their existence away from Earth, and not to interfere with their business.
