New Bohera is a flash to the real past, to surround myself with memories. Over time, I let my personal plans be driven out by personal opinions. That ends now, and that ends as fast as possible. I will use this region as my own little sanctuary, as i can no longer trust myself interacting in other regions. If I want to live the way I truly want, then I must change. Every day from here (5/29/2025) will have an entry to go with it. If i can&#39;t be forgiven by God, why should I expect any from the wonderful people that I&#39;ve spent the last while with?
