This is primarily a puppet storage region; however, mature, discerning, Trinitarian, Calvinist, Reformed Christian nations are welcome to submit embassy requests, engage in constructive dialogue, or apply for membership. We believe that the Protestant church today should align itself to Reformed theology, grounded in the text of the Bible. We do not support Charismatic practices of any kind. 

If you are interested in membership, please TG the founder, and include a short paragraph on why you want to join the region. Embassy requests and membership applications will be reviewed carefully and are likely to draw questions.
