This is primarily a puppet storage region; however, mature, discerning, Trinitarian, Calvinist, Reformed Christian nations are welcome to submit embassy requests, engage in constructive dialogue, or apply for membership. We believe that the Protestant church today should align itself to Reformed theology. While we love our brothers and sisters in Christ, we do not support Charismatic practices of any kind. 

If you are interested in membership or an embassy, please telegram the founder.
