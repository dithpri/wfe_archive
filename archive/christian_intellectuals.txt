This is a region where mature, thoughtful Christian nations are welcome to reside in peace.  We ask nothing from our members other than to observe two conditions of membership:  (1) appropriate behavior; and (2) political neutrality.  Failure to observe these conditions will result in immediate ejection.  Nations that require definition or explanation of either of the conditions of membership need not apply.  Membership is generally by invitation; however, if you are interested in membership, please TG the founder, and include a short paragraph on why you want to join the region. We review embassy requests carefully and may repond with questions.
