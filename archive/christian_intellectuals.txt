This is primarily a puppet storage region; however, mature, thoughtful Christian nations are welcome to submit embassy requests or apply for membership.  We ask nothing from our members other than to observe two conditions of membership:  (1) appropriate behavior; and (2) political neutrality.  Failure to observe these conditions will result in immediate ejection.  Nations that require definition or explanation of either of the conditions of membership need not apply.  If you are interested in membership, please TG the founder, and include a short paragraph on why you want to join the region. Embassy requests and membership applications will be reviewed carefully and are likely to draw questions.
