Everyone must help, whether you are rich or poor. Everyone must have the belief that there&#39;s always someone in a much worse situation than I am, and this person I want to help as a comrade. If one should say, &quot;Yes, but do I have to sacrifice a lot?&quot; That is the glory of giving! When you sacrifice for your community, then you can walk with your head held up high.
