The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was a Communist and Marxist&#150;Leninist political party in Czechoslovakia that existed between 1921 and 1992. It was a member of the Comintern. Between 1929 and 1953 it was led by Klement Gottwald. After its election victory in 1946 it seized power in the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d&#39;&eacute;tat and established a one-party state allied with the Soviet Union. Nationalization of virtually all private enterprises followed. In 1989 the party leadership bowed to popular pressure during the Velvet revolution and agreed to call the first contested election since 1946. In 1990, the centre-based Civic Forum won the election and the Communist party stood down.
