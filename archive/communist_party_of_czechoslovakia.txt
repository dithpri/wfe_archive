The&nbsp;Communist Party of Czechoslovakia&nbsp;(Czech&nbsp;and&nbsp;Slovak:&nbsp;Komunistick&aacute; strana &amp;#268;eskoslovenska,&nbsp;KS&amp;#268;) was a&nbsp;Communist&nbsp;and&nbsp;Marxist&#150;Leninist&nbsp;political party in&nbsp;Czechoslovakia&nbsp;that existed between 1921 and 1992. It was a member of the&nbsp;Comintern. Between 1929 and 1953, it was led by&nbsp;Klement Gottwald. The KS&amp;#268; was the sole&nbsp;governing party&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Czechoslovak Socialist Republic&nbsp;though it was a leading party alongside with the&nbsp;Slovak branch&nbsp;and&nbsp;four other legally permitted non-communist parties. After its election victory in 1946, it seized power in the&nbsp;1948 Czechoslovak coup d&#39;&eacute;tat&nbsp;and established a&nbsp;one-party state&nbsp;allied with the&nbsp;Soviet Union.&nbsp;Nationalization&nbsp;of virtually all private enterprises followed.
