[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] are part of a system. A system where bathroom stalls do not go all the way to the floor and locks are there as backup. &quot;A backup system? We&#39;re designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That&#39;s not a system. That&#39;s a complete breakdown of the system.&quot;
