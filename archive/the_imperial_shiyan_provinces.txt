We care not of your problems, you abide by the Emperor. All else is an act of heresy, and punishable by death or excommunication and banishment. If you wont serve in the front line, then you&amp;#39;ll serve in the firing line. However, the Emperor protects, so I will listen to your issues or ideas and ponder on them with or without your counsel.
