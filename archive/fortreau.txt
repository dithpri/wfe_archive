Fortreau stands unconquered and free!

Many thanks to the fine folks at TITO for defending our region!

[i]In visions of the dark night
I have dreamed of joy departed-
But a waking dream of life and light
Hath left me broken-hearted.

Ah! what is not a dream by day
To him whose eyes are cast
On things around him with a ray
Turned back upon the past?

That holy dream- that holy dream,
While all the world were chiding,
Hath cheered me as a lovely beam
A lonely spirit guiding.

What though that light, thro&amp;#39; storm and night,
So trembled from afar-
What could there be more purely bright
In Truth&amp;#39;s day-star?[/i]
