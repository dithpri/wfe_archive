Show some respect.[hr]This region is a memorial to the soldiers and civilians of all countries who have paid the ultimate price in war. Regardless of country, flag or ideology.[hr][i]They shall not grow old, as we that are left grow old,
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.
At the going down of the sun, and in the morning,
