&#147;You might be an intelligent person, but once you let someone else filter the world for you, you have no way to critically analyze what you&#146;re hearing. At best, absolute best case scenario, if they blatantly contradict themselves, you can spot that. But if they take basic care to maintain an internal logical consistency, which they all do, you&#146;ve got nothing. You&#146;ve delegated the ability to make up your mind.&#148;
