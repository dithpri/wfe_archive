[color=darkblue]Me and [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=gruffyrichard_and_hillbillybob/detail=factbook/id=1500156]the Anti-Fascist Boys[/url] decided that Lily was making this region very un-comrade like.
And so we took some good old Pizza and Amalgamated Cola and liberated this region.

A Message for Lily:
Every region you take we will take back with full force.[/color]
