Welcome to the ULMSP! Here in the Union, we believe:

1) Progressivism and conservatism can go hand in hand (although liberals are welcome here)
2) A goal-oriented and pioneering group of like-minded activists are the key to solving the world&#39;s most pressing problems
3) All political ideologies have at least a certain level of truth to them, and tolerance is key to a prosperous society
