The Concordat Forever! Watch our regional anthem [url=https://youtu.be/1qdDxCgKS0g]&#39;Region of Regions!&#39;[/url]

The Unitary Concordat is a regional alliance based primarily upon the good relations of three neighbors- Walterslandia, Sanghiem, and Cybor. A myriad of socio-political differences have been set aside to pursue mutual security, prosperity, and cooperation. Beyond the founding members, the spirit of the Unilateral Concordat is one of utility- that is to say, the Concordat and the members thereof seek the preservation and advancement of other regional members over and above non-member nations. Pursuant to this practical framework, individual members are free to work towards whatever goals they like, so long as they do not harm fellow member states.
