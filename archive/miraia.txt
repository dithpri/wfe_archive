The Region of Miraia is a fledgling, efficient nation, renowned for its barren, inhospitable landscape and compulsory military service. The hard-nosed, hard-working, democratic population of 5 million Miraians are effectively ruled by a group of massive corporations, who run for political office and provide their well-off citizens with world-class goods and services. Their poorer citizens, however, are mostly starving to death while being urged to go out and get real jobs. The populace has reasonably extensive civil rights, although these are mostly aimed at allowing them to buy whatever they like.
