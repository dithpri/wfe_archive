[color=blue][b]Welcome to [region=St Abbaddon]! Our region, being founded by a group of Role Players in the ancient past of 2003, has a rich and vibrant history. We have never had a founder due to being founded before they were common, so that puts us in a very unique minority of regions.[/color]


[color=orange]All WA nations are required to endorse our incoming Monarch [nation=short]Frankland[/nation]. There is an Endorsement limit of 2, so please do not seek more endorsements![/color]
