[color=blue][b]Welcome to [region=St Abbaddon]! Our region, being founded by a group of Role Players in the ancient past of 2003, has a rich and vibrant history. We have never had a founder due to being founded before they were common, so that puts us in a very unique minority of regions.[/b][/color] [b]We are a Protectorate of the New Pacific Order of [region]The Pacific[/region].
