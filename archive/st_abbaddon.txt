[b]This region has been temporarily captured by the [region]Europeia[/region][color=green]n[/color] [color=red]Republican[/color] [color=blue]Navy[/color]!

This looks like a nice place to settle down for a bit. I think I&amp;#39;ll stay a while. We brought a lot of liquor, and we&amp;#39;re willing to share!

All those who enter must identify themselves via a telegram to [nation=short]Operation Stealth Llama[/nation].

My friends from the [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=the_united_imperial_armed_forces]UIAF[/url] ([url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=the_new_inquisition]The New Inquisition[/url] and [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=the_land_of_kings_and_emperors]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/url]), [region]Kantrias[/region], [region]Albion[/region], [region]The Black Hawks[/region], and [region]Mazeria[/region] might chill for a bit too. [nation=short]Cerian Quilor[/nation] wanted me to pass along that he may attempt to set your UDL embassy on fire, however. :(

During this very pleasant and in no way hostile occupation, why don&amp;#39;t you stop by our [url=http://s6.zetaboards.com/Europeia/index/]community forums[/url]?
