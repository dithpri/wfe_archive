[b][color=green]Welcome to St Abbaddon![/color][/b] One of NationStates oldest regions, St A is one of less than 50 regions that are historically founderless, or were created before founders were added to the game and therefore has no founder listed. We are an old and calm region. 

[color=darkred][i]St A sympathizes with victims of raids and invasions everywhere and supports [region]the United Defenders League[/region].[/i][/color] 
 
St Abbaddon is rebuilding! For those who are [b]already members[/b] of the [b]WA[/b], kindly [b]endorse each other[/b] for [b]regional security purposes[/b]. 

Also, [b]please endorse our WA delegate [nation=short]Pseudocholinesterase[/nation]![/b] 

We laud our former delegates - [nation=short]Weed[/nation], [nation=short]Eidolonis[/nation], [nation=short]Spectaculawesomeness[/nation] and [nation=short]Hawkswind[/nation]!
