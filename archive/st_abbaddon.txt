[b][color=green]Welcome to St Abbaddon![/color][/b] One of NationStates oldest regions, St A is one of less than 50 regions that are historically founderless, or were created before founders were added to the game and therefore has no founder listed. We are an old and calm region. 

[b]Please endorse our WA delegate [nation=short]Pseudocholinesterase[/nation]![/b]

[color=darkred][i]St A sympathises with victims of raids and invasions everywhere, and supports [region]the United Defenders League[/region].[/i][/color] 
 
St Abbaddon has once again began to rebuild! If you are interested in helping join our region, let us know on our Regional Message Board.
