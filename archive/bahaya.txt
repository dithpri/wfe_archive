This unique &amp; serene archipelago was originally formed from the remaining peaks of Atlantis&#39; mountain range. The various peoples hail from nomadic Eastern seafarers, African navigators, and desperate Westerners who washed ashore. Their present cultures are based on their deity Oshun who provides them with bountiful seas filled with marine life. This region is protected by gargantuan coral reefs that make safe harbours for their many visitors. 
As a prized hideaway, the island countries here profit majorly from waves of tourists. Gladly, the hospitable BaHayans respect and welcome all who enter their waters, from the vacationing elite to the resilient refugee.
