Islas de Extravagantes is an archipelago of strange islands that exhibit anomalous geographical properties. Ships of refugees, colonists, and traders who have been lost at sea find themselves in its foggy, salty realm.

Any country with a flag and name that sounds like a normal country is welcome. Feel free to use the message boards to do some light role play. No stakes, just fun in-character storytelling.
