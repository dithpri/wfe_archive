I, the Matriarch of New Tequila, created this region to separate myself from the other nations in the South Pacific. 

You are welcome to join if you:

- are a nation situated in the South Pacific ocean
- share the same love of freedom, civil rights, and peace that New Tequila holds dear

New Tequila has been uninterested in the world at large for centuries. As such, we are somewhat naive about how things truly work on a global level. We welcome any help people wish to give!

[Disclaimer: I haven&amp;#39;t played Nation States in years and my grasp of political lingo is terrible, please keep this in mind]
