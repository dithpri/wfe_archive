[color=red][B]Welcome To The Eastern States[/B][/color][hr]The Eastern States are a group of independent Nation States, they have a council that is meant to &#39;govern&#39; the region, however many of the states have entirely different cultures and ways of life, new nations are welcomed into the conglomerate and the larger Nations enjoy watching them build and thrive.

Events are often held by the council to encourage the mingling of nation leadership, and nations often invite foreign ambassadors or visitors to grand events to show off their nations, sometimes skirmishes between rebels and even other states break out.
