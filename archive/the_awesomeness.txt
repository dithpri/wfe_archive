This is the Nation you want to be a part of.
Civil rights are our main focus and we want everyone to feel welcome, even though we mainly support left wing governing and democracy rather than monarchy. We genuinly believe that equality, political freedom, art, scientific and technical development and unity are more important than and have to be put before conflict, military and economy.
