[color=red][i]A duck walked up to a lemonade stand., He said to the man running the stand &quot;Hey! (Bum-bum-bum) Can I have governor?&quot; The man said, &quot;Sure, but give it back ok?&quot; The duck said, &quot;Alright bet!&quot; Then he waddled away (waddle waddle) T&#39;ill 5 minutes later. 5 minutes later he banished the man from the stand, and he closed the stand forever. This is what he said &quot;Don&#39;t be fascist, it&#39;s bad. Like grapes, become democratic!&quot;[/i][/color]
