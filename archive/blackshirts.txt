The Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale, commonly called the [b]Blackshirts[/b], was originally the paramilitary wing of the National Fascist Party and, after 1923, an all-volunteer militia of the Kingdom of Italy. Its members were distinguished by their black uniforms (modelled on those of the Arditi, Italy&#39;s elite troops of World War I) and their loyalty to Benito Mussolini.

The founders of the paramilitary groups were nationalist intellectuals, former army officers and young landowners opposing peasants&#39; and country labourers&#39; unions. Their methods became harsher as Mussolini&#39;s power grew, and they used violence and intimidation against Mussolini&#39;s opponents. -- Wikipedia[hr]
