The Panemian Islands are made of about 1 thousand of islands of different size and form. The main island is the place where the Republic of Panem itself is located. The Great Island makes the 60% of archipelago&#39;s territory. Other islands are mostly used for resourses - for example, Southern group of islands is full of coffee plantations. But about 30% of entire archipelago is still unsettled.
