Welcome to the Rejected Realms!

Please Endorse [nation=short]Frattastan ii[/nation] He will be your new delegate next update!

[b]Just wanted to say it&amp;#39;s been a pleasure, and a honor serving as your delegate for the last year. I won&amp;#39;t be leaving, I&amp;#39;ll always be around, and I&amp;#39;ll try to keep posting on the RMB as often as I can.

Thank You.[/b]
