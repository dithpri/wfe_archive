Sigil, City of Doors.

Claimed to be the center of the multiverse, Sigil is ruled by the enigmatic [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=the_lady_of_pain]Lady of Pain[/url].  

&quot;Sigil contains innumerable portals: any bounded opening (a doorway, an arch, a barrel hoop, a picture frame) could possibly be a portal to another plane, or to another point in Sigil itself. Thus, the city is a paradox: it touches all planes at once, yet ultimately belongs to none; from these characteristics it draws its other name: &quot;the City of Doors.&quot; This feature make Sigil a prime destination for travelers as well as a center of trade throughout the multiverse.&quot; - [url=http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Sigil]Source[/url].

For thematic purposes, embassies are considered portals.  All embassies accepted.

Any nation wishing to reside in Sigil is welcome.
