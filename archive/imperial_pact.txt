[b][i][color=red]Rules[/color][/i][/b]

&#149; Exercise Respect when talking to fellow members, treat them how&#39;d you want to be treated. And if that&#39;s like a piece of sh*t you&#39;ll have to fly in banland.

&#149; Use common sense, if you know something is wrong don&#39;t post it.

&#149; Don&#39;t try and loophole your way through. If it&#39;s not in the rules, then it falls under common sense.

&#149; Also, follow the Nationstates Rules.

&#149; And finally, have fun! We&#39;re not all buzzkills here!
