&#149; Exercise Respect when talking to fellow members, if you act like a piece of sh*t you&#39;ll have to fly in Banland.

&#149; Use common sense, if you know something is wrong don&#39;t post it.

&#149; Don&#39;t try and loophole your way through. If it&#39;s not in the rules it falls under common sense.

&#149; Follow the Nationstates Rules.

&#149; And finally, have fun! We&#39;re not all buzzkills!
