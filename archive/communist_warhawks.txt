&#147;It is difficult for me to imagine what &#147;personal liberty&#148; is enjoyed by an unemployed hungry person. True freedom can only be where there is no exploitation and oppression of one person by another; where there is not unemployment, and where a person is not living in fear of losing his job, his home and his bread. Only in such a society personal and any other freedom can exist for real and not on paper.&#148;

Freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in ancient Greek republics: Freedom for slave owners.
