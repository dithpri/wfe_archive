In where the Korean Peninsula used to be, exists a False Many-Worlds border. All the nations within this region exist simultaneously in the same position(at least in 3 dimensional space), at the same time. The region was created during the Second Pacific War, caused by the South Korean&#39;s experimental YQ-1270&quot;Time Bomb&quot; thermonuclear weapon. It has been theorized that all of these nations once existed in separate universes (According to the many worlds theory), and collapsed into our universe at the detonation of the YQ-1270, known by many who inhabit the Peninsula as the &quot;Foundation Event&quot;.
