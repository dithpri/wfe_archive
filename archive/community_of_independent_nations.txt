[b]OUR TIME ON SMALL FRIES (such as [color=red]THE RED FLEET[/color] -- [color=blue]KOREAN PEOPLES ARMY[/Color])[/b]

[hr][hr]

[b][color=red]This region has been giving quarter to several associated with leftist causes in the last few days, so you might have seen a bit of confusion as to what the Community of Independent Nations stands for during that time.  To be sure, our moral stand against the idiocies of mob rule, and the World Assembly as a whole, remains firmly in place, and we shall brook no resistance by children in need of better upbringing.[/color]

[i]I&#39;ve got this burning like my veins are filled with nothing but gasoline
And with a spark it&#39;s gonna be the biggest fire they&#39;ve ever seen
Cut me down or let me run
Either way it&#39;s all gonna burn
The only way that they&#39;ll ever learn[/i][/b]
