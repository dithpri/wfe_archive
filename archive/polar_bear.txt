The [b]polar bear[/b] [i](Ursus maritimus)[/i] is a hypercarnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic Ocean, and its surrounding seas. Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, and for hunting seals. Seals make up most of its diet. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals. It is difficult to estimate a global population of polar bears as much of the range has been poorly studied; however, biologists use a working estimate of about 20&#150;25,000 or 22&#150;31,000 polar bears worldwide.
