Into each generation, a Slayer is born and will live only to make you crawl in a hole and cry tears of sadness so that the Elder Gods can slumber with ease for another thousand years. Or until someone decides to take a nap. A generation where the guinea pig is a powerful symbol, but also a silent predator that lurks in the shadows, waiting to pounce on someone and make them have an over all bad day.
