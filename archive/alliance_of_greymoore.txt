The Alliance of Greymoore was created to protect neighbor nations by combining military forces and making the nation&amp;#39;s leaders work together. The Alliance was formed to prepare for the impending zombie apocalypse. One country was not present in the signing of the Alliance, so sadly he was left behind, but the nations have to move forward.
