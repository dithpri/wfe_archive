[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] put on some training wings today and took off into the sky!

However we spotted some cookies in your region and had to make an [color=red]emergency stop[/color]

After all, life is too short for one to not enjoy cookies. We thank you for leaving out those choco chip cookies, the best flavour, and in exchange, [color=#ff878d]left you this WFE.[/color]
