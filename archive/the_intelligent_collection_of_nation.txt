[b]Rules[/b]
[u]One[/u]
There no need to endorse anyone as a WA member but if you wish to you may.
[u]Two[/u]
There is no role-playing as of yet. Embassies are still part of this ongoing region as friendless isn&#39;t really RPing, it&#39;s just being nice.
[u]Three[/u]
There is room for advancement despite the no role-playing aspect in the form of Office Holding or being a WA Deligate. The Deligate can not change the parts of the region while those in office can. Office Holding will commence when the region becomes large enough.
[u]Four [/u]
Have fun and don&#39;t try to hard, this isn&#39;t a serious place.
