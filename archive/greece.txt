[b][color=blue]Welcome to Greece! Birthplace of Western Civilization and Democracy. Greece was the first area in Europe where advanced early civilizations emerged, beginning with the Minoan civilization in Crete and then the Mycenean civilization on the mainland. Greece is home to many ancient ruins, including the Parthenon, and shares the fine heritage of Mediterranean cooking, with souvlaki, spanakopita and feta abound![/color]
