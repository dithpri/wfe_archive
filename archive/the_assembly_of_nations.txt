[u][b]Welcome to The Assembly of Nations![/b][/u]

[i]The goal of The Assembly of Nations is to gather as many nations as it can who want to take part in a legislative process.
Every nation in the region is a part of The Assembly and is free to propose legislation to be voted on. 
Check out the constitution below, you may like it, you may want to amend it, you may want to preserve it exactly how it is.
The power is, collectively, in our hands. Make compromises, deals, friendships, and hopefully not enemies. [/i]
