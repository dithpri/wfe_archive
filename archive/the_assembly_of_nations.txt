The Assembly of Nations is an organization comprised of nations that have established themselves seperately from the United Nations. Are you tired of what today&#39;s politicians are doing? Then, this assembly is exactly what you are looking for. Isolation is our top priority when it comes to solving the issues on our own land. We pride ourselves in working together in order to solve these issues. Please, do not hesitate to join us. We are always accepting those willing to do whatever it takes to make this world a safer place. Gloria in Unum.
