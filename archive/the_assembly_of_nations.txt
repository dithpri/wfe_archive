Welcome to The Assembly of Nations! We are dedicated to being a democratic region that will not give in to fearmongering and staying a fair, beautiful, and safe region.

We are a new region carved out after seeing numerous takeovers, breakaways and resulting regions&#39; crumbling. We decided that we had had enough. So, we are now on our own and dedicated to the cause of creating a fair, habitable, and safe region for everyone. This is a great place to have your voice heard and to help mold a great region that upholds the principles of NationStates and of basic decency. If you&#39;re looking to rise in influence quickly, join today!
