This region is now under keep

In Punishment of its foolish Founder Tannerland we have taken this region. Once a region of raiders and fools, it has now been raided itself. 

To all of those who admire Tannerland, learn one lesson. Never follow what he did. For he angered the wrong nations, delcared war on the wrong people, and he is punished for it.

This region has died with its Founder, and its now a glorious tribute of Victory over the ignorant.
