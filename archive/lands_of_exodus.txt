After the desolation of all other nations in the GCB (Genuine Christian Believers) Cristosalem was all that was left standing. With enemies on all sides, Cristosalem&amp;#39;s armies retook the territory lost and renamed the land, strengthening their own empire and crippling their adversaries. However, the empire has become a solitary state, and weary of newcomers in this trying time. Now, it is time to rebuild physically, financially, and spiritually.

The Lands of Exodus are just that, a safe haven for refugees and exiles of all kinds.
