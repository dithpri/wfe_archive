Rainbow Fields is a place of unsurpassed beauty. Birds of paradise and brightly-coloured butterflies flit through the pure clean air. Huge flowers of all kinds grow abundantly by the clear waters of our many lakes and streams. And overhead is a great double rainbow, the brightest and most vibrant that you&amp;#39;ve ever seen.

Feel free to move here, and light up a spliff as you watch the unicorns and gryphons playing together in the fields. But not if you&amp;#39;re a fascist, or if your nation is fascist-themed. Fascism is vile, and we actively oppose it here.
