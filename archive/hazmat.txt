[color=red]Transregional Confederacy HQ[/color]

Hazmat is the current HQ of the Transregional Confederacy, an organization dedicated to being a third way against Raiders and Defenders. We capture Raider regions and hold them against Defenders. Why? Not any particular ideological reason. We simply exist to fulfill this role.
