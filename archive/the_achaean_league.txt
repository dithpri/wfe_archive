The Achaean League was a confederation of twelve city states who banded together for mutal protection from Macedonian invasion. I have created this Region to give that same ideal. Any nation that is seeking freedom from opression, a willingness to listen to others ideas and a desire to be heard, then you have just found your home.

Welcome to The Achaean League!
