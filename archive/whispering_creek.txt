Legend has it that the settlers of Whispering Creek were originally from a mystical land known as Furrtopia, a place of wonder and magic where anthropomorphic animals lived in harmony with nature.

According to the stories, the settlers of Furrtopia grew tired of their idyllic existence and decided to venture forth into the wider world. They embarked on a perilous journey across the mountains and arrived in the rugged terrain of Whispering Creek.

The settlers of Furrtopia were initially met with skepticism and suspicion by the existing residents of Whispering Creek, who were wary of their unusual appearance and customs. However, over time, they were able to win over the locals with their kind and friendly nature.
