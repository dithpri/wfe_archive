Wrecklandia is a place where you can focus on your own country. If you don&#39;t want to participate in RPGs and other stuff, then Wrecklandia is the place for you to relax and enjoy the cosy and rainy Wrecklandian weather while not having to focus too much on other nations. When moving to Wrecklandia, you can add the white rose of York to your flag. 

There are just a few important rules to keep Wrecklandia a safe place for all of its citizens: No spamming &amp; no offensive comments
Also your nation will be banned if it is classified as a dictatorship.

The main city in Wrecklandia is on the border of the two first nations in the region. In Westelend it is called Myntynshore and Nottys call it New Nottford. Most houses here are made of red brick.
