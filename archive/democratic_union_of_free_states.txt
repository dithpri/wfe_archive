[b]Despite its many victories, the shadow of inactivity has also succumbed to this Union. Fear not to those who supported its ideas, the Union, even though it is now no more, will continue to live on in another name, under a new region, under a new flag. Despite its fall the ideals of democracy and liberty will continue to be spread throughout the world of NationStates, and the ideas of this Union will inspire hundreds, even though it is dead, it has achieved the immortality of glory.[/b]

Citizens of the Union, you are all advised to move to [region]Lisseum[/region]

[i]Long live, Democracy[/i]
