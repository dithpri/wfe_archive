Canary Islands (NW Africa), a beautiful country that remains a Spanish colony.

The islands have gradually achieved more political autonomy since the 80s, but still have a long way to go for their right to self-determination to be recognized. Also, the islands&amp;#39; economy and social structure are still similar to that of a colony, and aren&amp;#39;t even able to administrate fishing or oil in their own territorial waters.

As of now, Canarians remain citizens of Spain and European Union.
