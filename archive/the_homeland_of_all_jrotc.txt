This is where ROTC Cadets unite as one to form one of the most diversified and unified regions in existence. We plan to try and be a tight nit community so that everyone has a say. Power will be divided as equally as officers can divide it through board, or convention. If you have a problem with an officer and you feel they aren&#39;t doing they&#39;re job bring it to the Founder, the WA Delegate, the CSM, or the Security officer and we will discuss the issue.
Officers will be decided based on nations strength, NCO&#39;s will be done the same only officers will have a say in it.
NCO&#39;s will not have any say in embassy affairs, with the exception of the CSM who is Panzier.
