This is where ROTC Cadets unite as one to form one of the most diversified and unified regions in existence. We plan to try and be a tight nit community so that everyone has a say. Power will be divided as equally as officers can divide it through board, or convention. If you have a problem with an officer and you feel they aren&#39;t doing they&#39;re job bring it to me, the WA Delegate, the Vice Delegate, or the Security officer and we will discuss the issue.
