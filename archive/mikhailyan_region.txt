A region where every member can count on peace and cooperation. The full name is Mikhailyan Region of the Second Convocation. It was founded after the collapse of the First Mikhailyan Region. 

We are open to organizing embassies if your region also supports peace and diplomacy. If you are the president of any state and want to join the region, then this is always welcome. All you have to do is just write to the region&#39;s founder or vice-delegate and ask to join. 

We are always waiting for you and your embassies!
