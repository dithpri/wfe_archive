Mare IV is a recently colonized planet, tens of lightyears from Earth. Though not the most Earthlike planet known, its proximity made it one of the first planets to be visited by a colonization attempt, known as the Scapha mission. However, Mare IV&amp;#39;s intense rotational irregularities, caused by a wayward asteroid impact aeons ago, lead to multiple short periods of heat or cold. The Scapha mission landed at the end of one of the coldest ice ages on record, and so suffered at the hands of the planet&amp;#39;s climate. At the planet&amp;#39;s warming, however, society was free to form and evolve, leading to many prosperous states and a vast network of seafaring traders. Until the next Ice Age, the future of Mare IV is bright.
