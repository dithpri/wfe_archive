The Great Opinion descended upon this Earth from the slopes of mount Olympus  in an envoy of Gilded Baboons. He told the emissaries and the delegates of disparate nations the truth of radical centrism and the gamer uprising. All who wish to foster the Gamer uprising and spread radical centrism are welcome into the Great Opinion&#39;s holy arms. Thou must deny partisanship and civil freedoms at every turn, support the proliferation of tendies and nuggies, and the uprising of the Great opinion&#39;s children, gamers. If thou art willing, then thou may be welcomed into his arms and join the growing ranks of nations who have sworn fealty to him.
