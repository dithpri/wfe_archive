[b][color=#901247]Welcome to the Commonwealth of Sayvillian Regions[/b]
[i]Deux R&eacute;gions, Un Peuple, Un Destin[/i][/color][hr][hr][color=#F9CB13]The [b][region]Commonwealth of Sayvillian Regions[/region] (CSR)[/b] is a largely nominal union between the [b][region]Kingdom of Sayville[/region] (KOS)[/b] and the [b][region]Kingdom of West Sayville[/region] (KWS)[/b], created to foster the development of a shared identity between the two Kingdoms. The Commonwealth is headed by two (ceremonial) [b]Consuls of the Commonwealth[/b], positions held by the two reigning monarchs of the KOS and KOWS, and act as the public figureheads of the organization.
