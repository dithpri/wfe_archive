Welcome to the [color=maroon][u]Union of Overlanders[/u][/color], founded December 4, 2011. 

Sit back, relax, and enjoy some Moosebearcat bacon. We&amp;#39;re all friends here, whether we&amp;#39;re imperial, capitalist, communist, dictatorial, etc. Our views may differ, but we all have a common goal, advancing The Union of Overlanders. May that goal unite us despite our governmental differences
