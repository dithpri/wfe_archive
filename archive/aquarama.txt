Welcome to Aquarama!

Home of luscious forests, pristine lakes, sensible people, wolverines, beautiful lighthouses, and in general, stunningly gorgeous landscapes. Of course, there are those pesky tourists, harsh winters, and the roadwork season. But hey... at least we have a pop-bottle deposit! Sound a lot like Michigan..? We can&amp;#39;t help that it&amp;#39;s God&amp;#39;s Country, sorry. But by all means, enjoy your stay.
