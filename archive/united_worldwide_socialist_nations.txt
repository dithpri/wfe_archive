[color=scarlet][B][i]Tonight, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] ride in celebration of a fallen companion. Every warrior has his or her time, and their passing to Valhalla is cause for revelry. Rest in Peace, and enjoy the fields of catnip, Zazu Cat. You were as fine a battle beast as any warrior could dream of having at their side. [/i][/B]
