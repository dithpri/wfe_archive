The Starry Sky is a continent mysteriously emerged in 306,448 BSD. Some say it&#39;s a work of magic, others believe it&#39;s involved in ancient extraterrestrial inorganic intelligence, yet nobody knows for certain. 
Hominid began to roam the continent around 200,000 BSD. There has been archeological site discovered with a ceremonial artifacts buried alongside several hominid skeleton. The artifacts resemble vintage disco ball, and that&#39;s the way ah-ha ah-ha I like it ah-ha ah-ha, which suggest a form of primitive funky religion.
The name of the continent, Starry Sky, probably came from this very ancient artifact.
