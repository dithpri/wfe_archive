During its lifespan, this region was committed to undogmatic Marxism, democracy, and equality. It welcomed all Comrades dedicated to the actual realization of Marx&amp;#39;s fifth epoch.

Under its final elected delegate, [nation]Calski[/nation], the residents of the region collectively decided, in order to ensure their security, that they should merge with the region [region]Communist International[/region]. All comrades who were once residents are welcome in its new home. Please join us there once more.
