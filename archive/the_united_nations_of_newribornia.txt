Years ago, my late parents founded the very region known as the Newriborbian Dynasty. The land I was birthed upon flourished until their separation three years prior to now, resulting in the leave of my mother and I back to the small town of people who said to her &#148;There&#39;s no way you can do that&#148;, leaving an inexperienced young man-as well as thousands of innocent people-to fend for themselves in a government that no longer functioned properly until he fled and left it to rot.

But, now, I have grown enough to fledge my own path &#151; and to bring back my fields from the grave! Who chooses to join me, in advance: I, Fhegamsa Kay Etrovania-Ripper, thank you.
