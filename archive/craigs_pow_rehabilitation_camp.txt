Welcome to the CCU&#39;s very own POW Rehab Camp. This place is an enclosed, barren, and barely hospitable place.

You are probably here because you did a bad in the CCU. If so, you have committed a crime that resulted in your kick or ban from the CCU.

If you are a visitor, you are not welcome here. This area is strictly for POWs of the CCU.
