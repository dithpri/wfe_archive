The once grand republic of Suurland has expirenced a great Civil War, after that, it ceased to exist. Now the greater Region is loosly unifed by a Council, which doesnt own any legislative, executive or judicial of itself. The Council, which is organized democraticly, consists of countries more or less democratic. Outside Obeservers may press the claim that the council is obsolete, but, for the people of Suurland, its the only thing which resemblees in some parts the Old Republic, that was not perfect at all, but still better than the now rulling order of war and dictorship.
