[color=#ff99a3]The White Lotus Society appealed to many in the Qing Dynasty for its worship of the Eternal Mother, or Wusheng Laomu (&amp;#28961;&amp;#29983;&amp;#32769;&amp;#27597;). It was said that she would &quot;gather all of her children on the new millennium into one great family.&quot; Many in the dynasty were shocked by allowing those of all genders to &quot;interact freely&quot; with one another.

This region is not so religious as its original incarnation, but instead centers around the modest principles of peace, equality, and cooperation. Nations are free to vote as they please and do as they wish. [/color]
