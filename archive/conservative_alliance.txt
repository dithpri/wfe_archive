The region bound by the Confederate-Federal Treaty, the Conservative Alliance is a region that supports nations with right wing cultures and policies.   We do not seek to have conflict with other regions but we will defend ourselves and our allies if necessary.  The Conservative Alliance welcomes all nations but only those who have right wing values will be the most comfortable here,obviously.
