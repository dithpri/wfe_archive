[color=yellow][b]Under the ocean, I found a treasure
It was my heart, not gold or silver that you could measure
Just a king of my castle, going to battle
Ain&#39;t no giant here too tall I couldn&#39;t handle
Sometimes you gotta stand for something
Sometimes you gotta stand your ground
So I&#39;ll keep my head up, I&#39;ll keep my head up
I&#39;ll keep my head up
I got the fire, I got the fire, I got the fire
I got the fire this time
I&#39;ll take it higher, I&#39;ll take it higher
&#39;Cause I got the fire[/b][/color]
