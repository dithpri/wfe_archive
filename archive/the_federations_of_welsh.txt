Welcome to The Federations of Welsh. Here at The Federations of Welsh we hope to become the strongest and most well-rounded region, so if you believe somebody is being disrespectful please report it to this email --&amp;gt; eadowd&amp;#64;gmail.com and we will get it sorted out.

RULES: 

Nations being disrespectful or disregarding the region or other nations will face a part-time ban, if you continue to break that rule it will turn into a permanent ban.


To ensure that our region maintains power over all other regions on the global stage, please endorse our Regional Delegate and everyone to the World Assembly.
