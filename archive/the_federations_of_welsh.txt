The Federations of Welsh is a 2026 regional alliance established to unify the decentralized administrative and cultural territories of the Welsh corridor. Moving away from a unitary model, the FoW operates as a &quot;centrist&quot; cooperative, balancing local autonomy with collective security and trade. It serves as a neutral arbiter in Atlantic trade disputes and is a primary hub for international maritime and green-tech diplomacy.

ALL ARE WELCOME TO JOIN!
