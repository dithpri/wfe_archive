A safe haven for any one who has been role-playing or rejected. We like to role play, but it is not required. We are fair and democratic, and the WA Delegate mostly runs things, so, the founder is not a dictator. If you are unhappy with how any officers are treating you, please telegram [nation]Terrenana[/nation]. If you would like more info about us please telegram [nation]Terrenana[/nation].
