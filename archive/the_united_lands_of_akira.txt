The United Lands of Akira function on three main pillars: Diversity, Freedom and Equality.

Diversity: We believe in the acceptance of all cultures and ideals of any individual and strive to lead the front on this point. We do however strongly disagree with the forcing of one&amp;#39;s culture on another person and infringing on what we see as basic human rights, such as human life, human dignity, etc.

Freedom:  We believe in freedom and liberty in all facets of living. We support freedom of speech, freedom of choice and freedom of media. We believe in the choice of military conscription, but still support an effective military force in order to protect our nations.

Equality:  We strongly support democracy and equal rights that are beneficial to all.
