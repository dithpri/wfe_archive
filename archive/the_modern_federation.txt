A planet rocked by a World to end all Wars is not as dead as it once seemed. Civilization as we know it will never be the same. Several settlements remain, spread across the planet, working tirelessly to restore their technology and reach their former glories. The time is now to join the RP to end all RPs. Join the eternal struggle to control the world. Many have tried and all have failed, but the question that will always remain: will you be the first to succeed?
