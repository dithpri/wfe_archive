[i]We&#39;re gonna get drunk and eat chicken fingers, me, you and the old man. He&#39;s gonna be here in about 20 minutes. 

Ricky, life isn&#39;t about getting drunk and eating chicken fingers all the time, alright? Lahey&#39;s right. 

Lahey&#39;s right? 

Why don&#39;t you try doing something with your life for once, instead of living in this car like a drunken idiot, eating chicken fingers, getting drunk.

You think you&#39;re so smart &#39;cause of your dumb book learnin&#39;, Julian. Well, you&#39;re not that smart. I know what&#39;s going on. You&#39;re just showing off on friggin&#39; TV again. Hey, look at me, I&#39;m Julian the big smart guy. 

I&#39;m warning you, Ricky. No blues music, no Ray on my friggin&#39; lawn drunk and no chicken fingers. Don&#39;t test me.[/i]
