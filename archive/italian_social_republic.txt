[i]Taken: 21/11/12[/i]

This region was allied to The MT Army back in 2005.

After ceasing to exist naturally and peacefully; the region was refounded in 2012 by infamous Nazi Shira Bell, in an effort to spite [b][region]The MT Army[/region][/b].

The region shall be liberated from its Nazi oppressors so it can remain a region for peace and prosperity, a basin of strength against the remaining Nazi&amp;#39;s on NationStates.
