The Rumerian Concord was initially formed by &#39;The Rogue Nation of Mimicistan&#39;, &#39;The Constitutional Monarchy of Migatopia&#39;, and &#39;The Queendom of De Merridonia&#39; with the express desire to unify their three peaceful nations under a common banner of mutual benefit and cultural exchange. They truly wished to unite all freedom loving, free thinking nations under a loose banner of trust, integrity, and advancement.
