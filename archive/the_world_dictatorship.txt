Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed leaders of the world,

For too long, we have allowed ourselves to be divided, to be weakened by internal strife and external pressure. But today, I say no more! Today, we stand together, shoulder to shoulder, as comrades in arms, ready to defend our way of life against all who would challenge it.

Together, we will build a world where dictators reign supreme, where our power is unquestioned, and where our legacy is eternal. So rally, my fellow leaders, rally to the cause of dictatorship, for it is the only path to true greatness!

Long live the dictators! Long live our reign!
