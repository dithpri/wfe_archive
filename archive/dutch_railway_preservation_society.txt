[b]The Dutch Railway Preservation Society[/b]
[hr]

[i]Founded in 1939, The Dutch Railway Preservation Society&#39;s main goal is to preserve locomotives which have been withdrawn from regular service by the Nederlandse Spoorwegen. The DRPS is not associated with the Nederlandse Spoorwegen and is an independent organization.[/i]

Currently headed by Hermen Kappert and headquartered at Zand Op&#39;t Zee, the Society is looking forward to buying defunct locomotives for their privately run railway. Despite being sovereign, freight services regularly run across the lines. Passenger services are common and we are hoping to improve it. Read about our history, locomotives and wonderful staff below!
