The United States of the Pacific consists of a variety of nations. We have a very impressive military that protects us. We range from all different types of nations, Commonwealths, Kingdoms. From No Light and their impressive police force, to Domisia&amp;#39;s strong economic level. It is highly recommended that all residents to this region is a World Assembly Member. Order is expected, anything less will result in banishment.
