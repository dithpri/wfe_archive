[b][color=blue]Well, [region]The Empire of Exus[/region] burned short and bright,
We raided a couple times,
And had few members.
[nation]Vamperiall[/nation] loved this region,
Put time, money, and hope into it,
But, alas, the members weren&#146;t active enough.

This region now stands monument to the hope of one person to create a haven for all, and to the infuriatingly inactive players that people put their trust into.[/color][/b]
