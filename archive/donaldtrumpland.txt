[color=brightred][u]New nations entering DTL without telegramed permission will be ejected.[/u] [/color][hr][/b]


[color=ivory]From our DTL WA Delegate, [nation]The Confederacy 0f the Republic[/nation].

[b][u]The founder issue poll results were unanimously in favor of a redo.  [region=DonaldTrumpland] is now closed for remodeling.  

Our new affiliated region [region]Mar A Lago Club[/region] is now open for colonization and for all new embassy requests.[/color] 

[color=gold] Attention: All embassy requests for [region=DonaldTrumpland] will be denied until further notice.  Additionally no entry will be granted to DTL for the foreseeable future.

Those that do not read our WFE yet still ask for embassy request will be considered fools and be routinely ignored.[/u][/b][/color]
