[color=ivory]From our DTL WA Delegate, [nation]The Confederacy 0f the Republic[/nation].

Our founder issue poll results were unanimously in favor of a reboot.  Our new affiliated region, [region]Mar A Lago Club[/region], is now open for colonization and all new embassy requests.  Please take advantage of this excellent opportunity for temporary relocation while our reconstruction is making DTL great again.  All DTL nations are welcome.  However, those who will not relocate for our necessary renovation shall be considered enemy sleeper cells.  

Thanks,[/color]
