[color=ivory][u]From our DTL WA Delegate[/u], [nation]The Confederacy 0f the Republic[/nation].[/color]

[b][u][color=red]NOTICE:[/color]

The founder issue poll results were unanimous in favor.  [region=DonaldTrumpland] is now closed for remodeling.  

Our new affiliated region [region]Mar A Lago Club[/region] is now open for colonization and for all new embassy requests. [hr]


[color=gold] Attention: 

Clearly, all embassy requests for [region=DonaldTrumpland] will be denied until further notice.  As previously stated, no entry will be granted to DTL for the foreseeable future.

Those that do not read our WFE yet still ask for embassy request or entry into the region will be considered fools and will be ignored.[/u][/b][/color][hr]
