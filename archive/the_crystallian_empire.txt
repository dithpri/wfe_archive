I withdrew from Osiris after two years of high level activity, with my six year old WA. I am tired of GCR politics, please let me rest.

I was the highest influence nation in Osiris for three months, and the 10th Pharaoh of the region. Sometimes I think it was best I walked away in December 2013.
