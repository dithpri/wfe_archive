Nations in Paelmoria are the remnants of the once mighty Paelmorian empire, which fell and broke apart centuries ago. Nations still maintain a relatively similar culture. All members of this region must adopt the Almid as their national currency. The strongest and most influential nation in the region is Almoran.
