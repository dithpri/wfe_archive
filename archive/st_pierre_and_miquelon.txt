Saint-Pierre and Miquelon is a small archipelago located in the North Atlantic Ocean, just off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. It consists of two main islands: Saint-Pierre, the more densely populated, and Miquelon-Langlade, known for its rugged landscape and natural beauty. The islands are characterized by rocky coastlines, windswept landscapes, and a cool maritime climate, with fog being a common feature. Despite its northern location, the archipelago enjoys relatively mild winters due to the influence of the surrounding ocean.
