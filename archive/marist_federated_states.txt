Much has been lost from this region&#39;s proud history, but some has been saved, chronicled in [url=/page=dispatches/nationid=2053382][b]these scattered dispatches[/b][/url]. In its prime, the [b]Marist Federated States[/b] fought [b]the SCUT[/b], whose existence you can read more about [url=/page=dispatches/nationid=1959238][b]here[/b][/url], allied in war with [b][region=Force][/b], and defended its borders from repeated attempts at invasion (though some attempts were nonetheless successful). For a time too, it was a signatory to the [url=/page=dispatch/id=918924][b]PAR Agreement[/b][/url].[hr]
