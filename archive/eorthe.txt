The world goes by many names, and [I]Eorthe[/I] is only but one of them.

Set in an alternate world, isolated from all the other nations and their happenings, on a planet similar to our own, yet not quite the same.

Those seeking to join should contact the founder or current regional delegate.

Although isolated from other nations outside of Eorthe in terms of roleplay we acknowledge the existence of the World Assembly and it&#39;s resolutions as our equivalent to the United Nations. Whilst not compulsory nations are encouraged to join the World Assembly or risk being treated as a pariah state.
