Divine Beast Vah Ruta was built ages ago by the Sheikah tribe to ward off Calamity Ganon and to protect Hyrule. However, Ganon arose again, and turned the Divine Beasts against the Sheikah. It was taken back by Link and now serves as a region for EPSA Targeting Practice and to protect [region]The East Pacific[/region].
