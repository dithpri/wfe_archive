[color=#3a9a5c][b]Welcome to the Transvaal!
Welkom in Transvaal!
est. Mid-2024[/color][hr][color=#fe9a31]A gathering place for pro-Boers, pro-Afrikaners, and the Boere and Afrikaners themselves. This region is a safe haven for the Afrikaner, the Boer, and those who oppose the genocide of these populations.

Please do not involve the Transvaal in any military operations. We are an independent region free of any regional conflicts. We will defend ourselves [i]and our allies[/i] if attacked but do not take sides in regional wars.

We are firmly AGAINST the ideas of Bolshevism, communism, socialism, anarcho-communism and left-wing ideas of any form.[/b][/color][hr][color=#2550cd]Endorsement Cap (subject to change): 0

The WA delegate is devoid of all powers. Raiding this region is therefore useless.[/color]
