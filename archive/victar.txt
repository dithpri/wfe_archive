White sands and blue seas mean a beautiful place to come when you want peace and serenity. With a range of animals, from tropical wolves to blob fish, who inhabit the caves all across the island. On the island are two nations, Pernisland, a religious land where locals are ready to do what needs be to keep the Gods happy. Religious freedom is welcome, although frowned upon. The other is a thriving society called Nero Roma. A social democracy with one of the world&#146;s leading basket industries. Close by lies Durengard. Run by a tyrannous dictator who is more focused on protecting his land from those who wish to take it, than on the way he treats his people. Whilst political freedom is almost unheard of, their belief in free speech is held dear.
