The Aurora Islands are a group of man made islands in the middle of the pacific ocean about 50 years ago. The islands were created for companies to test technology, and as such have technology far advanced beyond the rest of the world. Originally only for corporations, cities have sprung up around the islands. Though the primary language is English, a number of other languages can be heard on the islands as the islands attract companies and people from all over the world.
