If you like the idea and want to be part of it you can join the main map, or make your own independent map (for yourself or for others as well) and I&#39;ll add it here as long as there is some kind of &quot;portal&quot; to make interactions possible between all nations of the region.

Read the dispatch pinned below to have an idea of the basic rules I have in mind.
