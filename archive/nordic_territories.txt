We have roleplay, a casual population, and monthly elections! All embassy requests and nations that join are appreciated. (Except for fascists) 

-Don&#39;t forget to endorse our delegate (until we have elections) [nation]Dollystana[/nation]!

-Looking for an opportunity to be an influence? We are looking for nations willing to recruit!

-Sit down and chat with us over a can of [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1371304]Nordic Blue[/url][sup]TM[/sup]. Nordic Blue is the official drink of the Nordic Territories, [color=blue]drink Nordic Blue, it&#146;s better than Mountain Dew![/color]

As a new region, we are small and are looking to become larger. Joining early will give you more prestige in the future![/b]
