ISAF2 was created in late 2002 or early 2003(it has long since been forgotten when exactly) by a group of new nations from the South Pacific region. Initially a strong roleplaying group, the region never grew beyond roughly 15 nations.  The region was always grounded in firm friendships that developed despite most of us having never actual seen one another.  Over the years, the region has grown smaller, until now, only the Founder of the region, Nighthawk, remains, as a last remnant of a bygone age.

Some notable nations included; Cerealean, Robonic, Alibakkar, Blank, and Beth
