ISAF2 has been around almost since the start. having been founded in late 2002 or early 2003(it has long since been forgotten when exactly) by a group of new nations from the South Pacific region. Initially a strong roleplaying group, the region never grew beyond roughly 15 nations. The region was always grounded in firm friendships that developed despite most of us having never actually seen one another. Over the years, the region has grown smaller, until now, only one of the original nations remain.

Some notable nations included; Cerealean,Robonic,Alibakkar,Blank,and Beth
