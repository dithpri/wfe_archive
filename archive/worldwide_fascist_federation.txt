[b][u]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b][/u]

[I]Captured: 05.12.17[/I]

[color=red]This former Fascist region has been captured by the mighty Anti-Fascist warriors of [region]The MT Army[/region] and shall serve as a museum against HATE in perpetuity.

Refounded by [region]The Red Fleet[/region] (TRF) in 2012, dedicated to the past victories of [nation=short]Vippertooth33[/nation] and [region]The MT Army[/region]!

Its invasion serves as a reminder that hate mongering will not be tolerated by the truly free people of this world. We cannot allow hate to spread to the young and impressionable of society, because it will only hurt/slow the progression of humanity in the long run.[/color]

[nation]Vippertooth33[/nation]: The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing![/color]
