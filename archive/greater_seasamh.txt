Greater Seasamh is an alliance of nations in order to create a stronger front. We stand together so that we may be strong. In Greater Seasamh no nation is ever alone.
All nations in Greater Seasamh support each other in their ventures. No matter what sort of nation you run, no matter how you run it, you will always have Greater Seasamh at your back.
We will do raiding if people are interested.
