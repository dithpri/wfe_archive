This region is a memorial dedicated to the 11-17 million people murdered by the foul hand of Adolf Hitler&amp;#39;s nazis, as well as to the many more lives ruined by the destructive nazi ideology. Feel free to pay tribute to the victims here, or to share survival stories of yourself or people you know.
