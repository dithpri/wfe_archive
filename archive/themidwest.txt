Places where what is best for our citizens comes first, and leaders who aren&amp;#39;t afraid of making the tough decisions, even if it upsets big business. 
These are the standards by which The Midwest operates on every day.
Large, heartless corporations are frowned upon.
Organized religion is never thrust upon you.
Personal freedoms that don&amp;#39;t harm anyone else are encouraged.
Human Rights are paramount.
We are anti-war.
We want to keep our citizens safe, happy, and have a positive influence on our region.
Come on over and check us out. Stay a while. Chill with us and have some coffee. Have any suggestions? Are we missing out on anything? Let&amp;#39;s grow and have fun together.  
Until then, keep safe.
And smile on your brother.
