[b][color=red]NOTES:

1. Please send[/color] [color=green]Crumbaker[/color] [color=red]a telegram (here in the game) with your [u]actual[/u] name and Civics period so Mr.C. can award extra credit appropriately.  Extra credit will be awarded on the final day of grade-entry for nations that are [u]up-and-running and present in this region on that day[/u]. Students whose nations have ceased to exist by that point will not receive extra-credit points!

2. CHANGE OF PLANS &#150; Extra credit points for playing NationStates will be posted under Week 16 Participation (PW16 in IC).[/color][/b]
