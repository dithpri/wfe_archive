[b][color=blue]Because the &amp;quot;school class&amp;quot; designation has been removed, student-created nations are now at liberty to leave this region if they see fit.  Feel free to explore other regions in the NationStates world, become the founder of your own region, or stay right here if you like.  Whatever course you choose, long may each of your glorious nations prosper![/color] (Please see the Regional Message Board below for important messages.)
