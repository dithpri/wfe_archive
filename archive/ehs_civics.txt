1. Please [u]do not[/u] endorse [/color][color=green]Crumbaker[/color] [color=red]or[/color] [color=green]Seaholistan[/color] [color=red]for World Assembly Delegate.  As a rule,[/color] [color=green]Crumbaker[/color] [color=red]will endorse every student-founded WA member nation in EHS Civics.

2. Please send[/color] [color=green]Crumbaker[/color] [color=red]a telegram (here in the game) with your [u]actual[/u] name and Civics period so Mr.C. can award extra credit appropriately.  Extra credit will be awarded on the final day of grade-entry for nations that are [u]up-and-running and present in this region on that day[/u]. Students whose nations have ceased to exist by that point will not receive extra-credit points![/color][/b]
