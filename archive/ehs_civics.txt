1. Please [u]do not[/u] endorse [nation=longnoflag]Crumbaker[/nation] or [nation=longnoflag]Seaholistan[/nation] for World Assembly Delegate.  A student-founded nation should hold that office.  As a rule, [nation=longnoflag]Crumbaker[/nation] will endorse every student-founded WA member nation in EHS Civics.

2. Please send [nation=longnoflag]crumbaker[/nation] a telegram (here in the game) with your [u]actual[/u] name and Civics period so Mr.C. can award extra credit appropriately.[/color][/b]
