The Strong Nations of Dion are just that and more! Dion is a Spanish name that means dedicated to God so that&amp;#39;s what we are. As long as the number of communities within the Strong Nations of Dion are manageable Praefecus Dion himself will check to see if you&amp;#39;re qualified to be in this region. He will be pretty lenient at first to build up a large region but once we hit about 15 regions he may start rejecting nations.
