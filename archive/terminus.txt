Welcome to the land of Terminus, the homeland and private residence of the Talleyrand Family and the final resting place for all who legitimately bear the surname Talleyrand on Nationstates.

The steward of the land is the Lord Commandant of Terminus, also recognized as being the ruling emperor of Terra. A historical archive of the the Talleyrand Family will eventually be provided here, as well as a private forum dedicated for the Talleyrand Alliance, which composes all members of the family.
