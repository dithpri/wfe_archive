[COLOR=BLUE]The [b]NPA[/b] has got the strongest and the best soldiers, believe me. I went into the war room a couple days ago, and their skill is just tremendous. No other tagging group is as big or as powerful as the NPA. So tough. With the NPA, our enemies cower in fear and they cry like little babies. And they keep TNP safe! So proud of the great work they do, and if you too are patriotic, you can join this elite task force [url=https://forum.thenorthpacific.org/topic/9145375/]here.[/url][/COLOR]
