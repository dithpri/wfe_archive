[b][u]Left Communism[/u][/b] is a region for Communists that reject the Vanguardist and Marxist-Leninist (Stalinist) currents of the international communist movement influenced by the Bolsheviks. We are to the left of Bolshevism and related ideologies; being more in line with the rebels of the Kronstadt Rebellion and the Spartacist League. Currents within Left Communism include Luxemburgism, Council Communism, Libertarian Socialism, and so on. Socialists and Left-wing Anarchists are welcome; Tankies will be tolerated unless rude or disruptive; reactionaries will be banned on sight.

This is [b][u]NOT[/u][/b] a gameplay region; we do not raid or defend here. Take it somewhere else.
