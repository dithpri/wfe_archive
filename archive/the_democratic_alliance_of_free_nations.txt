[color=006600][b][i]We were, at one time, at war with [region]The Black Riders[/region]. After a ruthless onslaught, our defense faltered for a single moment. This moment was taken advantage of by our enemy. However, we rallied forth under the command of [nation=shortnoflag]Stellam[/nation], and proceeded to decimate the Black Riders&amp;#39; forces. Thus, we are now and forever free of their oppressive rule.[/color][/b][/i]
