All are welcome that uphold our values and enjoy intellectual discussion, we&amp;#39;ll start talking when more people come.  

The Inklings is an informal, but serious literary discussion group in Oxford who encouraged narrative/fantasy works with Christian values entwined.  

Idealism against modernism.  Passionately resisting the modern movement and functioning as an oasis against it.  &#147;To be in a group of friends is to be armed from influences from without, the public opinion of the group is tiny but it matters more than 10,000 from without it.&#148;
