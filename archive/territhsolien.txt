Territhsolien is a Napoleonic fictional world of politics, religion, and war. It is a laid-back, role-play game. It is a world based on early to mid 19th century Europe. This doesn&#146;t have any commitment so you can leave anytime you like, but please actually interact if you want to be here. You may use your factbook to write about your nation and the board too make decrees as well as in your factbook. From that I can create your nation on a map eventually. This original idea is based on the region [region]Aurne[/region]. Please, if you know anyone interested, tell them to join.
