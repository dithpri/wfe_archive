[nation]Simonia[/nation] has been vigorously moving regions ever since they left [region]Anegana[/region]&#133;
And Anegana is password protected!
So&#133;
Now, we have a region to host polls to let other NSers decide [nation]Simonia[/nation]&#146;s region every three days and if one region wins ten times in a row, that region gets Simonia as a &#147;permanent&#148; member!
You are free to suggest regions for the polls in the RMB.
