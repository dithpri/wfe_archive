The &quot;Temple of Hylia&quot; is an ancient, overgrown sanctuary filled with eerie, lifelike puppets.
Once a place of worship, it now exudes a strange, unsettling aura. 
Stone pillars rise around the grand hall, with countless puppets standing frozen in various poses, their glassy eyes reflecting the dim light. 
Some resemble priests or soldiers, others mythical creatures, all waiting silently as if ready to spring to life.
A faint, haunting melody occasionally echoes through the temple, blending sacredness with an unsettling sense of something gone terribly wrong.
