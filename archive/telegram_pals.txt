	[b][i][color=gold]God has willed us to take this land[/color][/i][/b]

[hr]

[b]Twice this land was lost. Not to the devil, but to the ignorance that is man. Once this land was decimated and forgotten. Upon these hills and mountains, there were people who thrived under His name. The more He called out to them, the more they disappeared. Here lies upon this grave what remains of them. Blessed be those who come to remember, but keep in the mind that in your remembrance is a path taken alone.
