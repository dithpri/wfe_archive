[i][color=maroon]This is the Garden of Kadesh. For 13 thousands of years we have protected it from the unclean. If you have come to join us, we will wait until all of your crew have disembarked, before destroying your ship. If you have come to consume the Garden(or nebula), you will be removed at once. The Turanic Raiders, who came before you refused to join and were destroyed. Like theirs, your ship has already defiled this holy place. What are your intentions ~ Kadeshi[/i][/color]
