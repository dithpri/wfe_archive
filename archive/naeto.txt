NAETO was established on April 4, 1949 as a political and military alliance among 29 North American and European countries. The organization was created as a response to increased Soviet aggression in the wake of World War II. Since the end of the Cold War in the late 20th century, NAETO has taken action around the world to ensure the security of its members. One of the core tenets of NAETO is Article 5, which states that an attack against one member of NAETO is an attack against all members. The only time Article 5 has been invoked was following the 9/11 attack on the United States when NAETO allies joined the U.S. in the &#147;war on terror.&#148;
