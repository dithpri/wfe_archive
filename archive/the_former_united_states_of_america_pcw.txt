The USA dissolved after a civil war. The states disbanded and later reformed several smaller nations. The United Northern States of America governs the states east of the Mississippi and north of Virginia, with its capital in Philadelphia. The Confederacy of Georgia consists of the southern states. The Democratic Republic of the Plains Nation, with its capital of Des Moines, spans from the Mississippi to the base of the Rocky Mountains, with the Texan Federation to the south. To the West is the Allied States of the Union Brotherhood, otherwise known as the California Commonwealth, with its capital in Los Angeles. The southwest is disputed between the Rogue Nation of Lycan and the Mexican refugees of Cholos Y Tortugas.
