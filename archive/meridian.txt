 [b]- Overview[/b]
 Meridian is a medium cluster of islands within the Atlantic Ocean with straits connecting five of the twelve major pieces of land to form a pentagon in the center. Overtime, the water inside the pentagon has become fresh, and the hilly land bridges stop the salt water from mixing. The insides of this geographic phenomena include a very, very, deep trench that remains unnamed and unclaimed by any country within the region. There are few general rules or laws within the region, including that the region may vote on a WA Delegate, etc. over one being declared. In sense, the region in whole is governed as a republic, though the countries within may use any system of government they please.
