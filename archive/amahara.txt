The region of Amahara was once a unified empire but it broke up during the Early Modern period owing to a combination of internal and external pressures. Today, it is a region composed of multiple independent states (many broadly conforming to the borders of ancient provinces). Their attitudes and ideologies are diverse, but all of them share a religion - Amahara Shinto - and agree - at least in public - that they owe religious fealty to the Apostle of Amahara whose court currently resides in the old capital region of Sumerakyo.
