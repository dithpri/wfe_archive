The region of Amahara was once a unified empire but it broke up during the Early Modern period owing to a combination of internal and external pressures. Today, its many states (many broadly conforming to the borders of ancient provinces) are fully independent from one another. Their attitudes and ideologies are diverse and some of their rulers have even crowned themselves as emperors. Nevertheless, all of them share a religion - Amahara Shinto - and agree - at least in public - that they owe religious fealty to the Apostle of Amahara whose court currently resides in old capital region of Sumerakyo.
