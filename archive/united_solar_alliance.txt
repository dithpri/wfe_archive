[colour=blue][b][u]Welcome to the United Solar Alliance![/u][/b][/colour]
We are a new region based around the real life Solar System each one of us has their own planet/moon but we all share Earth. We welcome all and you will not be discriminated at all. Our region is hard sci-fi so basically if I wanted to create a forcefield I have to find an area of science in which forcefields are proven to be possible.

RP: It&#39;s the year 2250 and Earth has run out of resources so the nations have looked to the stars (or a star) and have colonised the planets of the Solar System. Despite many efforts conflict for resources still exist.
