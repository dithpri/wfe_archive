The nations of Earthica have stepped onto the forefront once again after two years of turbulence.
The world has changed...
New nations have formed on the Capric continent, Africa is still a stalemate but what has remained the same is the determination of each nation for success.
The great Earthican depression is a distant memory now but still the civilized world remains small.
The ambition of all people in Earthica is to acquire as much influence as they possibly can as much of the world is fair game.
Struggles will arise, wars will be fought but also friendships shall be maintained and forged.
Join the struggle for dominance today!
