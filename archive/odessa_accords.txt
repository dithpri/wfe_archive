WELCOME TO THE [b][colour=#ff0000]ODESSA ACCORDS[/colour][/b], COMRADES!

The Odessa Accords is more than just a region, it is a bastion of [colour=#ff0000]genuine left-wing[/colour], anarcho-socialist and communist principles. Our ultimate goal is to forge a region that is firmly rooted in and adheres to the teachings of authentic socialist visionaries, from [b][colour=#e93a3a]Lenin[/colour][/b] to [b][colour=#e93a3a]Trotsky[/colour][/b], [b][colour=#7f0000]Sorel[/colour][/b] to [b][colour=#7f0000]Limonov[/colour][/b], and [b][colour=#121111]Bakunin[/colour][/b] to [b][colour=#121111]Makhno[/colour][/b]. Here, we reject the distortions and encroachment of our ideologies by the [colour=#ffaa00]liberal perversions[/colour] of the [colour=#ffd800]bourgeoisie[/colour]. We are committed to the principles of [colour=#c21e56]economic equality[/colour], proletarian power, and the ultimate liberation of the working class.
