&amp;quot;Everything about this darned place is a maze, from the land to its people; you can&amp;#39;t enter these islands and exit in a straight line, you can&amp;#39;t find your way across a city without taking several twists and turns, and no one gives you an honest answer anywhere anymore.  Sometimes I wonder why we settled these accursed islands, but I am glad we live someplace that gives us a challenge.&amp;quot;---Dame Agrona, leader of Valravenis
