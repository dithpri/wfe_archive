Founded by former members of the Conservative Republic of Bentaria. The CRB senate passed multiple laws against liberal states, such as ours. The last straw was when we nominated 2 liberals to put on the Supreme Court and 4 of the 6 conservative nations voted against them. We are creating this region as a liberal version of the CRB.
