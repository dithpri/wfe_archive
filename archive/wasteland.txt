Here is no water but only rock
Rock and no water and the sandy road
The road winding above among the mountains
Which are mountains of rock without water
If there were water we should stop and drink

[hr]

I have seen the dead plains of Cathay.
I have crossed the mountains of Death.
I have seen the shadow cast across Abaddon.

Better to die a thousand miles from anywhere,
than to have seen the white water-lotus close in its shadow.

I have slept among the ruins of Xanadu,
where the winds never cease 
and the [i]wulwulleh[/i] is wailed by the dead.
