Here is no water but only rock
Rock and no water and the sandy road
The road winding above among the mountains
Which are mountains of rock without water
If there were water we should stop and drink

[hr]

It lies hidden in that gigantic shadow called Cathay-
Vague and vast as the midnight Heavens.
I have seen the dead plains of Black Cathay.
I have crossed the mountains of Death.
I have seen the shadow of Xangi cast across Abaddon-
Better to die a million miles from Yezd and Ater Quedah,
than to have seen the white water-lotus close in the shadow of Xangi!
I have slept among the ruins of Xaindu,
where the winds never cease and the [i]wulwulleh[/i] is wailed by the dead.
