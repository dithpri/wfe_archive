What is Sev? The answer lies hidden somewhere in the ancient Sevilian ruins, if you dare disturb the past.... unfortunately they have been closed off to non-native visitors for the last 300 years. Enjoy our [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sev_Wide_Web]brochure[/url]! 

Some of the ghosts have been contained and moved to our exclusive [url=http://forum.sevspace.com/]space zoo[/url] for your enjoyment. Happy happy joy joy!
