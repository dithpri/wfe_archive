[b]Welcome to the Nervous System[/b]

We are the Hives we&amp;#39;re born of [b]one mind melded together[/b]. We have lived in this region for thousands of years. You may see it as a greenish to yellowish stain on a wall with slime and protruding veins coming out of it. But if you touch us you&amp;#39;ll become [b]infected[/b] with the [b]Hive virus[/b]. 

Once infected you&amp;#39;ll serve us!

So go ahead we need more hosts to expand our empire and the Hive Queen&amp;#39;s influence.
