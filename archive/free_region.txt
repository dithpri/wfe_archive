This region has been forcefully evacuated by the forces of [region]The Delian Empire[/region] for treasonous acts against the Empire and its allies in [region]South Orkney[/region]

We would like to thank [nation]Lamboa[/nation] for its cooperation in the effort as well as all of our allies in South Orkney, including its Crown, King William of [nation]Scotias[/nation].

This region is now officially a protectorate of [region]The Delian Empire[/region], and all [region]Free Region[/region] residents are given the status of second-class citizen because of their treasonous actions; however, we may open up a path for complete Delian citizenship in the future.
