Hello and welcome to beautiful thoughts,

Here is a little information about what inspired me to create this region. My entire life I have been attracted to ideas, thoughts, feelings, people, places, music, behaviors, experiences, and concepts which seemed complex, transcendent, difficult to grasp, fun, challenging, and more. Now, I would like to interact with similarly minded individuals for mutual enlightenment, connection, and intelligent conversation.

In time as we grow a WA delegate will be appointed.
