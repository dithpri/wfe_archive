BACKGROUND
Three centuries of Northmen raids tapered off following the adoption of Bear Worshiping by Lord Anders Bjorn I in 515; conversion of Bjorn Shore occurred over the next several decades. Many countries have invaded Bjorn Shore, but have been held back by the region&#146;s super power, and original state, Nanulakia.
