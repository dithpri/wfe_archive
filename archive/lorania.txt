[b]&#149;OVERVIEW&#149;[/b]
Welcome to Lorania, a region that held the right to fairness above all else.
Lorania was the culmination of many people&#39;s dreams to create the ideal region.
Here at Lorania, we asked you to respect the golden rule: [b]Treat others the way you&#39;d like to be treated[/b][hr][/color]Lorania was a thriving region, with an active political scene and RMB, where memories were made, where many would call home. Sadly, after months of conflicts and divisions, the region entered a crisis, it&#39;s fate sealed by the loss of the founder.

Lorania surpassed all it&#39;s expectations.
