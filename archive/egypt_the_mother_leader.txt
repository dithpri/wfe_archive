Egypt is always the mother, which is protected by Allah -the only GOD-; where others hide there from enemies and strangers; whose army is bestowed with braveness from our GOD - ALLAH; all Egyptians are proud to be like that. Egypt, the mother, is strong with her CITIZENS. Only good citizens can be a father(president) for others. To know who can be a good Egyptian president, read about how to be a good father and about how to be a LEADER NOT a BOSS, because a good president should be &amp;quot;The Father Leader&amp;quot;.
