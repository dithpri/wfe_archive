[B]The Confederated Peoples Nations[/B] (or the [B]CPN[/B])

Here at the [B]CPN[/B] we pride ourselves in insuring the rights and liberties of our member nations.All nations who join us should be prepared to defend and fight for your allies.

Recruitment is our top priority as of right now,if you are a member I would highly suggest making a recruitment telegram and sending it to newly founded nations.I would highly discourage sending recruitment telegrams to nations already apart of another region out of respect of that region&#39;s guidelines.
