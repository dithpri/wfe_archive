In our region, The German Anti-Facists, we believe that if anyone salutes Hitler shall be shot. It might seem harsh, but we believe that it is wrong. Anyone that is showing any love of Hitler or the Nazis shall be ejected and banned, we believe that it is wrong to show support to German Fascists. Any culture and/or ethnicity is welcomed in our region. Even Jews,Muslims, Christians and any other religion.
