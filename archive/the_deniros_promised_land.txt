The Promised land is an authoritarian area that only cares for its citizens. We do not believe in embassy&amp;#39;s or trade with rival nations. We act as one and aid each other through tough times. Inhabitants of this area do not like outsiders and are very isolated from the world...yet with the combine strengths of its nations, it is a global powerhouse.
