Humanity began on the Old World, or so the legends say. In time, they defiled their home with conflict and greed. In a desperate effort for survival, the nations of man reached out into the stars. Great vessels were constructed and drifted out into the darkness, carrying the next generations of mankind forth in frozen slumber. As time passed human empires flourished in the immense vastity of space, claiming system after system under their banners, as new unknown signals loomed in the outskirts of known space. The age of colonialism is setting his dusk and a new age raises in the endless horizon.

Now, in this new dawn, man has raised once more to survive, build and grow on new worlds.
