Welcome to the club, snacks are in the pantry. We have various types of snacks and meals. Bathroom is upstairs to the left. Dessert is in the freezer, don&#39;t take too much. Buffet is upstairs to the right, and you can go downstairs to eat. You can easily tell where the mess hall is, its the giant room with all the tables.
