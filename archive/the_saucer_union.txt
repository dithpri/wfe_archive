Welcome to the club, snacks are in the pantry. We have various types of nuts, cheez-its, and goldfish. Soupiel might go shopping for some more when he can afford. 
Bathroom is upstairs to the left.
Dessert is in the freezer, don&#39;t take too much.
Have fun, and remember:
drin ur cerel
eet ur cofe 2
Anth is here w/ the 2.1K skrubs.
He doesn&#39;t get the cheez-its.
TOG is now in, but we&#39;re on a shortage of rust sauce atm...
Ed needs to go buy some, but there are anti-war protestors&#39; corpses all over his doorstep.
We hate the environment, I guess, considering how all of us disregard environmental quality for economic efficiency.
