The [b]Necron Inversion[/b] is an extremely isolated and inaccessible region hidden deep inside the subspace.

The &#39;Inversion&#39; was artificially created by [b][nation=short+noflag]the Necron Species[/nation][/b] more than 2.1 bio. years ago. The &#39;Inversion&#39; is constructed to serve as a cluster of super-maximum-security fortress biospheres for the [b]Necron Species[/b].

Although the [b]Necrons Species[/b] is strong term isolationist - there are some low profil contacts to the [region]SICON[/region].
