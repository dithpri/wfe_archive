The [b]Necron Inversion[/b] is an extremely isolated and inaccessible region hidden deep inside the subspace.

The &#39;Inversion&#39; was artificially created by [b][nation=short+noflag]the Necrontyr[/nation][/b] more than 2.5 bio. years ago. The &#39;Inversion&#39; is a cluster of super-maximum-security fortress biospheres for the [b]Necrontyr[/b].

Although the [b]Necrontyr[/b] are strong term isolationist - there are some low profil contacts to the [region]SICON[/region].
