Suffolk 09/11/2014 replacing New Suffolk 18/06/2012, a region dedicated to the memory of the fallen from Suffolk

Founder of Suffolk: The Lower Tawe - Died in the great turkey raid on Norfolk - December 2009
The nation of Finlayville passed away just a few short weeks later after going into Norfolk to avenge the Lower Tawe.

In 2010 Suffolk was invaded, natives were scattered and two passed away, we shall not forget Pieta and McGod who fought hard to defend our region.

While not in battle the deaths of our brothers and sisters will not be forgotten
