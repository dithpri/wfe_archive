Minderra&#39;s vast expanse is a land of extremes. From its frigid tundras to its lush green plains to its harsh and unforgiving deserts. It is a land populated by nations and peoples whose attitudes are equally as varied as its climates. 

Together they strive and they struggle, they build and they destroy. But what does the future hold, a glorious golden harvest for the Minderran nations? Or the fires of death and destruction and the swift strike of the Reapers scythe?
