Animus, the fourth planet in the Cerinian System, is a cold and bitter planet with frequent snowstorms and inhabitants with fur to brave the harsh cold out near the far end of the habitable zone.
Cerinia, the third planet, is on the other end. A lush tropical planet with high biodiversity, its high heat lead to many species with high surface areas to evaporate heat that superficially resemble intelligent dinosaurs.
