THE ODE TO THE ASS
Shall I compare thee to a summer&amp;#39;s day?
Because thou art hot. Like hella hot. Cause it&amp;#39;s hell. And hell is hot. So...
Rough hands do caress that darling butt of you, my bae
Dat ass deifies the laws of physics; those curves that flow
Always too hot, that ass of yours, my love, does burn
(It burns because hell metahpor, see second line)
When that butt is near it makes me yearn
My only wish is to make it mine
Too good for this world dat ass does exist
Butt thy eternal beauty remains hella hot
When it is away it is desperately missed
Hot as a summer&amp;#39;s day. Or the pits of hell. Or Chris Evans. (Sorry I lost my train of thought)
So as long as men can breathe and eyes can see
So long lives dat ass, no dat ass gives life to me.
