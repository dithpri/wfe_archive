[b]On [i]G.O.A.T.[/i] (a [i]Government Owned Alien Territory[/i] in space)
A birth of magnificent &amp; magical proportions took place
But the birth was not finite, it was infinite...
And thus began the beginning of the new race...
A race which bears no prejudice, no judgment, but boundless freedom
But on that same day...
Another more terrifying birth took place
The birth of evil
And as she herself split into two, rotating in agony between two ultimate forces
The pendulum of choice began its dance
It seems easy, you imagine to gravitate instantly &amp; unwaveringly towards good
But she wondered, &quot;How can I protect something so perfect without evil?&quot;[/b]
