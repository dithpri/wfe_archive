As you step out the portal, you stare at the floating, pale purple towns, before realising you are floating. You remember that this dimension has microgravity conditions. After flying around for a bit, you see a huge floating island, with a busy town covering it. Another thing that catches your eye is the huge, medieval castle dominating the town.
