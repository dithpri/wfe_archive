Let communism ring forevermore onto this noble land... And hopefully we won&amp;#39;t get invaded again. I hate getting invaded. The invader changes the factbook entry and everything. I feel like I lose control of the region. Then again, all I have to do is go into my administrative settings and just change everything back. Still, it would get annoying if I had to do it more than once. Hopefully it won&amp;#39;t happen again...
