The territory occupied by the often-allied nations of DURN is a land of contrast and natural beauty. From the barren wastelands and megacities of Incorporatia to the fetid jungles of Eremora, DURN territory is populated by savages of every level of civilization. See the jungle burning with nuclear fire as the savages are swept aside to make room for totalitarian dictatorships, and marvel at psychotic rulers bent on doing nothing but tormenting the weak and the helpless. DURN is no region for the faint of heart, the weak of stomach, or the sound of mind.
