Once upon a time, [color=red]The United Socialist Federation[/color] was a collection of allied [color=red]Socialist[/color] nations aimed at creating an alliance of left communist or democratic left nations. The [color=red]USF[/color] aimed to provide a strong bastion against capitalism in the WA and NationStates, and to create a large socialist alternative [color=red]opposing brutal dictatorships[/color] that do not serve the interest of the people.[hr]

The noble Federation however was subsequently annexed by [region]Raxulan Empire[/region].

But after two months the red flag was hissed again by our socialist brigades.
