Xabrin is a very large continent. It&#39;s 4,181,650 square miles. Which is very big. It is completely owned by the nation Xearnas. It has a few large peninsulas and some islands too. This continent is mostly desert, but the desert is filled with life. Trees and oasis dot the landscape. There are also many cities. The top left which is surrounded my mountains is the capital of Xearnas. The islands on the top right are used for defense, lots of people still live there though.
