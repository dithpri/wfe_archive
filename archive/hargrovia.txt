We lament the exit of [nation]DoomPire[/nation] and [nation]SANGWOO IS HOT[/nation], however we have many opportunities to reinforce and rebuild our government and seats of power. Elections will take place regularly, and I encourage active residents to be responsible and vote. Voices of Hargrovia&#39;s residents are more important than I can say. Enjoy your stay in Hargrovia, have a wonderful day, and in days to come.
