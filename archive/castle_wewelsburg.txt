[i][color=grey]Once a prized possession of &amp;#39;Nationalsozialistische Volksstaaten&amp;#39;, a &amp;#39;silver&amp;#39; member of right wing uprising.

The court has come. 
The court of the Nations and into the courtroom will come 
the martyrs of Majdanek and Oswiecim. 
From the ditch of Kerch the dead will rise, 
they will arise from the graves, 
they will arise from flames bringing with them the acrid smoke 
and the deathly odour of scorched and martyred Europe. 
And the children they too will come, stern and merciless. 
The butchers had no pity on them.
Now the victims will judge the butchers. 
Today the tear of the child is the judge. 
The grief of the mother is the prosecutor.
