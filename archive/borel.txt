The Planet begun as a ball of flaming rocks, being formed because of two big sized planets crashed into each other, one of the planets was an ice planet while the other was a rocky one which explains the high amount of craters around the planet. The Planet was hurling at high speed towards a system and it managed to get into orbit, into the habitable zone. The water took years to melt and plant life has started to appear a few billion years ago. Animals started to appear and eventually, humans came and colonized the Planet.
