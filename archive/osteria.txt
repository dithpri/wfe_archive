          Osterria is a military alliance of nations working toward a common goal. That goal is the betterment of their people, the strength of their nations, and the end to those who would oppose them. It is composed of only those with the bravery to stand against tyrants, to do what others would not. To stand as one against those who stand as 100. This my friends, is why Osterria is also an alliance of those who refuse to stand down. Which is why we refuse to be denied, even if it comes to the use of nuclear weapons.
