The Union of Independent and Free Nations promotes the independence of nations that are trapped under a government of its ruling nation (E.G. Catalonia, Brittany, Bavaria). Our union allows any type of nation to join of any ideology, to truly recognise the unity within our union. We respect all views, and support our members with compassion and empathy.
