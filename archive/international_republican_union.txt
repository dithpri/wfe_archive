We are a [b][i]republican democracy[/i][/b]!

Citizenship applications, regional activities, legislation, and anything not listed below may be brought to poll by any Citizen&#39;s request, and all Citizens may vote - each poll must last 48 hours, and a two-thirds majority is required to pass.

Trusted Citizens are responsible for setting up the polls; as a privilege, they may manage embassies and the WFE without a vote.

The Founder reserves the sole right to border control, executive status, and appointing Trusted Citizens. Anyone may be WA Delegate.

None shall infringe upon others&#39; liberties.
