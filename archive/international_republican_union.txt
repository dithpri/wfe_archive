Recommended SCP of the day:
SCP-583
Why: A fresh take on the lost episode Creepypasta and one that manages to surpass all others in two ways. Firstly, it is nigh devoid of clich&eacute;s. Sure the characters all die, but it works in context. Secondly, the cognitohazard effects push this SCP from &quot;meh&quot; to &quot;horrifying&quot;.
Rating: 8/10
