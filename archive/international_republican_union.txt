[i]Thank you for having visited the [color=blue]International[/color] [color=red]Republican[/color] [color=blue]Union[/color] - NationStates&#39; foremost authority on republics since 2013![/i] We respected all ideologies that adhere to Republican values, be they socialistic or capitalistic.

This IRU is now a memorial to remember the beliefs that this great region has represented throughout it&#39;s lifespan. Thank you to all of our allies, citizens, and residents. We couldn&#39;t have done it without you &amp;lt;3
