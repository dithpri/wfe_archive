The IRU is now a [b][i]democracy[/i][/b]!

The rules to our system are as follows:

1. All decisions not pertaining to regional security or maintenance are to be put to a vote.
2. Each vote - in the form of a poll - will last about two days. In order for the poll to pass, at least two-thirds of participating IRU citizens must vote in favor of it.
3. The Founder is responsible for enforcing the will of the citizens and establishing new polls as they are requested. The Founder reserves the right to make new polls without request and to take his time.
