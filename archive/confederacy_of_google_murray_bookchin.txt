Dedicated to the teachings of Social Ecology, residents of &#39;Google Murray Bookchin&#39; practice Libertarian Socialism and Democratic Confederalism. Believe that only way to govern is to re-create community, divest power to local authorities, and focus all efforts into technology and environmentalism. Praciting communal ownership, Social Ecology rejects capitalism. Which by definition seeks to make profits at the cost of the natural world,  the coffers of the workings class, and the human spirit.  Any nation practicing Social Ecology, or trying to reform into Social Ecology is welcome to join.
