This region stands in memory of times gone by.  A young region, wanting to stand up to the tyranny of raiders, but unsure how to go about it.  A region oppressed but never broken, battered but never killed.

The community of Eagle Clan has moved on and drifted away from this place.  This region is being kept open as a memorial.
