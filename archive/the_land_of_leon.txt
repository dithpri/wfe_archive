We are the The Land of Leon, a group of nations that pledge their support to Lord Leon, who is our kind ruler. Nations who are part of The Land of Leon are only required to assist the Followers of Leon in wars. Assistance is not required if you have a reason not to get involved. Other than that, nations are completely in charge of what goes on within their borders. Lord Leon will assist any nation in need if asked. All nations welcome.
