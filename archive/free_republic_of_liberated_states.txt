Found upon the principles of republican-conservativism, we are a group of nationalist nations that have love for our region. We strongly favor the right wing although we allow left-wingers to run for political offices (Far left exempt, but may join). If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask our founder or delegate. Please check the dispatches below to see how our government works.
