Found upon the principles of republican-conservativism, we are a group of nationalist nations that have love for our region. We strongly favor the right wing although we allow left-wingers to run for political offices (Far left exempt, but may join). If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask our founder or delegate. Our government consists of a President and his cabinet, Vice President and his advisers, congress, and an appointed senate. An election date will be held for each of these positions.
