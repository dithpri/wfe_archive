[b][color=#4facfa]Welcome to the UBPSSIF, a region, which will perish soon.[/color][/b]

Originally, there were only two nations in the [region]UBPSSIF[/region], [nation]Sunset Sea Islands[/nation] and [nation]Futanarien[/nation]. The region was prospering and several other nations applied for membership. However, times changed in the blink of an eye. One region after another ceased to exist. Only time will tell how many nations will survive the age of stagnation.
