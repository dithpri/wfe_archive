The [region]UBPSSIF[/region], The United Border Principality of the Sunset Sea Islands and Futanarien, originally consisted only of two nations, [nation]Sunset Sea Islands[/nation] and [nation]Futanarien[/nation]. After a period of growth another nation, [nation]Flups[/nation] joined the union.
Even though the nations ethics diverge strongly, they share a strong bond of friendship. The reasons for these ties are lost to the sands of time.
