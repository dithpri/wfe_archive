Welcome to the first and only benign dictatorship where your actions on NationStates will have real-world effects!  (Well, eventually.)

As we are an isolationist region, raiding, embassies to/from other regions, and transfer in and out of the region are highly discouraged.  Having said that, We will grudgingly tolerate your presence in the region as long as you adhere to the orders of Our Leader, which will be issued on rare occasion, and to the decisions of the Hierarchy.

The punishment for all crimes against the State shall be exile to Texas.

Have a nice day!
