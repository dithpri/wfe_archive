[hr][b][color=#ED4719]The Trophy Case of the [region]Appalachian Empire[/region]![/color][/b][hr]

[color=#ED4719]This region serves as the embassy hub for the empire of [region]Appalachia[/region]&#39;s hallmark captures and conquests throughout the years. It&#39;s hard to find the important stuff when it&#39;s buried amongst all the other territory the empire has seized after all this time. People really do need to learn how to take care of their stuff, otherwise the empire wouldn&#39;t be so outrageously huge!

[hr][b]DO NOT TOUCH!!![/b] These artifacts are priceless! Keep your grubby hands off of them!!! &amp;gt;:([hr][/color]
