The Benevolent Autocracy was forged in the ashes of forgotten constitutions and the dismantled thrones of false kings. Inspired by divine mandate and the secure and all-encompassing regimes of the past, Britannia seeks not to emulate the successes of those who came before it, but to surpass them. Carrying with the decorated history of its predecessor, and the zealous loyalty of its satellite states, Her Rule is a sure - and policed - one. 

Britannia sits at the capital of the empire, representing and enforcing the states beneath her. Britannia&amp;#39;s Eternal Queen rules with an all-seeing eye, and merciless hand.
