Welcome to the prosperous region of Parliamentary democracy.

As you can see in the title this region is composed of a parliament. This makes it even more democratic than other regions, that do not have such an addition.

To join into such a parliamentary position you can just send a telegram to the founder or to the prime minister to your motivations to join this post of duty.

The local laws are being written.
