[b]The Western Commonwealth[/b]

[i]~Welcome, to this brand new region~[/i]

The western commonwealth is a casual, conservative region. There are few rules and we will have elections once we have the population for it.

[b]Main Rules[/b]
[i]Don&#146;t upset the mods[/i]
[i]Don&#146;t cause drama, though you can debate[/i]
[i]Don&#146;t try to overthrow the government[/i]
[i]No communists, leftists[/i]

I have all sorts of plans for this region. Whatever people want is what we&#146;ll do, weather it be roleplay, a map, discord, whatever. 

[i]If you have any questions, comments, concerns, suggestions telegram Cavisco [/i]
