Soveregin Anthem of the U.S.N.K :

If a foreigner may, any given day
Even attempt to subjugate Kali,
Let him prepare for a fatal destiny,
Which menaces such brave aggressor.
In the tenacious struggle of fruitful toil,
That which brings a glow to men&amp;#39;s faces,
Your sons, simple farm hands,
Gained eternal renown, esteem and honor.
The firm will, bonded with truth,
Nest for the spirit of labour,
Embracing the atmosphere of Mount Javlir,
Will go forth to all the world.
O land of soft, fresh breezes
And verdant trees so fair,
With the Creator&amp;#39;s glory
Reflected ev&amp;#39;rywhere.
