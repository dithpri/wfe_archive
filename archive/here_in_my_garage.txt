just bought this new Lamborghini here. It&#146;s fun to drive up here in the Hollywood hills. But you know what I like more than materialistic things? Knowledge. In fact, I&#146;m a lot more proud of these seven new bookshelves that I had to get installed to hold two thousand new books that I bought. It&#146;s like the billionaire Warren Buffett says, &#147;the more you learn, the more you earn.&#148;
