Welcome to Dawn&#146;s Embrace!

Dawn&#146;s Embrace is a thriving region under the control of its parent region, North America. We value collective security, sovereignty, and international peace, and we firmly oppose raider and invader organizations.

Please note that the World Assembly (WA) Delegate here holds a non-executive position for specific reasons, allowing for greater participation from all member nations in decision-making.

Join us as we embrace a bright future of collaboration and unity!
