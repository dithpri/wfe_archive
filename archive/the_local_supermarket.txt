[6/06/2013 8:23:14 AM] SPQR: :P
[6/06/2013 8:25:24 AM] Krimson Vulika: yep it has no wad
[6/06/2013 8:28:24 AM] Krimson Vulika: invade them and get discounts on groceries

After my ex-Grandson insisted for weeks, I finally told SPQR we could. We&amp;#39;ll be emptying your shelves of Coffee, Tea and Bacon. 

The Supermarket and all its goods belong to [region]Kantrias[/region]!

Our allies, [region]Albion[/region] and [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] can have some half-off discounts. They helped out too.[/b]
