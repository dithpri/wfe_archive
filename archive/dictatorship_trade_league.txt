The DTL is for dictatorships hoping to trade with each other. And also do anything they can to help each other protect from non-autocracies.
The DTL also aligns to a few codes of Autocracy.
But as well does not sanction any members for it&#39;s policies.
The DTL also follows a strict guideline that goes :
&quot;Under no circumstance may a nation in it&#39;s alliance declare war on another nation in it&#39;s alliance. Thus can only be done if the nation has committed betrayal against it&#39;s fellow nations that it shares ties with. If the nation does so. Then it shall be punished in any form possible.&quot;
Also. Please do not spread racism or hate in the comments or we will ban you from the DTL.
