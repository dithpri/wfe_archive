Rough description: The kingdom of thanatos is a government-in-exile, it is under development, it&#39;s a constitutional monarchy where the constitution is minimal outlining basic laws but is set in stone and can&#39;t be changed (once it&#39;s been written).

 The monarch is called the SKULL who&#39;s job is to direct the country on its actions. While the main government is minimal, the states can make the majority of laws for their territory within the rules outlined by the constitution.
 
The country doesn&#39;t exist outside of international space\water\land as such it will mostly if not exclusively exist on ships with the main government on its own ship(s) and the states on their own ship(s).
