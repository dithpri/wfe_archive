[b]A new order is rising.[/b]

The time will come when the putrid and fragile structure of contemporary political and philosophical thought will collapse.

That day, our regime of [b]order and stability[/b] will be accepted as the only viable solution to the failure of the old society, guiding the new civilization through a utopian era of [b]peace, prosperity and progress.[/b]

The fraudulent ideas and concepts of the old order will be replaced by our vision towards a prosperous future, they will be remembered as an example of backwardness and primitiveness. Only our doctrine will dominate as the single true and acceptable thought.

The world will learn to serve and obey one master: [b]Us.[/b]

Cut one head and two more will take its place.
[b]Hail Hydra![/b]
