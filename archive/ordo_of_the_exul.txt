[color=red] Welcome to Ordo of The Exul. All Nations are welcome to follow our Path.[/color]

[color=purple] We are The Exiled, The Banished but we still stand for our own Empire.[/color]


We fight only to [b]Prevail[/b], Conquer only to [b]Redeem[/b], and Conquest for [b]Glory[/b]. We are nothing but banished, wounded warriors of war, Nations of the forgotten and rising rulers of this world. We shall stand our ground and fight till our demise, we don&#39;t entertain the thoughts of defeat nor our downfall as we will pierce through our obstacles and our enemies, not letting a single piece of fragment disrupt our Will and Force from keeping us walking down our path to victory.
