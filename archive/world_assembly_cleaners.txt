Welcome to the World Assembly Cleaners, a new region dedicated to invading and - if necessary - destroying regions with World Assembly delegates not sufficiently partipiciating in World Assembly votes and proposal supports.
This is an important mission because it helps removing the burden these many inactive region place on a potential World Assembly region. Times without any proposals at vote are frequent, and proposals without paid mass telegrams have practically no chance to go to a vote, no matter how good their quality is.
We have no forum currently, which means that we will plan our operations on the regional message board.
Our target are small, inactive nations with a delegate.
