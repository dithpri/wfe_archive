This week&amp;#39;s verse is; John 16:33 I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.&#148;
What it means: Don&amp;#39;t worry (though there will be trouble) &amp;amp; keep moving. Besides you have God who created an entire universe and can defeat the devil w/o breaking a sweat watching over you.
