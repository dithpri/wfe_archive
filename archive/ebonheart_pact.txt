[b][color=Red]Announcement from your Founder, [nation]Greater-Hammerfell[/nation].[/color][/b]

[i]It is with great regret that I must announce the failure, and closing of this Region. We had a good run, but it seems as though we ran out of steam... If any brave hero comes across this Region and wants to reclaim it, please do so. You have my permission. I would love to see the Ebonheart Pact and the [b][u]TATO!!![/u][/b] But it seems my vision has been doused. My apologies Ebonheart, I let you down.[/i]
