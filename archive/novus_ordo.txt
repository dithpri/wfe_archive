The Black Swordsman [b]Kirito[/b], his harem (including [color=orange]Asuna[/color], [color=FF0000]Silica[/color], [color=pink]Lisbeth[/color], [color=green]Suguha[/color], and, of course, [color=FFCC66]Sandwhich-kun[/color]), his daughter [color=666666]Yui[/color], and his friends [color=660000]Klein[/color] and [color=brown]Agil[/color] have discovered a new VRMMORPG called [i]NationStates Online[/i] (NSO). Gameplay apparently includes being tyranical, staying up at strange hours to take advantage of the mysterious &amp;quot;update&amp;quot;, and using CH-47s to pick up and transport entire countries. Kirito and co. have formed a new guild for this game: [u]Novus Ordo[/u]. Let&amp;#39;s hope no one dies this time.
