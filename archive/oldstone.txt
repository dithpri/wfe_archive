The stronghold of Oldstones sits on a hill above the Blue Fork of the Trident. As it has for a thousand years and will for a thousand more, from this seat the Kings of House Mudd do rule. The castle&#39;s stones and foundations remain strong and the statues of ancient River Kings line the walls of its many great halls within. The curtain wall encircles the stronghold of Oldstones, nine towers stand sentinel along its walls like the emeralds that sit in the River kings crown. The stronghold overlooks the bustling metropolis of Oldstone a city that has thrived in its shadow. The land is bountiful and rich but well-guarded, all have learned to kneel to the Kings of the Rivers and Hills. To the House of Mudd.
