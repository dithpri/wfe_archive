We are a small group of nations that was combined from our 7 founders:
[b]Pride, Envy, Greed, Anger, Sloth, Gluttony, Lust[/b]
But due to an uprising Civil war, all 7 founders were executed in the battle between the people and the 7 founders. This battle was called, &amp;#39;The death of mankind&amp;#39;s 7 enemies&amp;#39; Due to the horrible history of the 7 nations that these 7 founders had lead, a political election took place after one year of the Civil War electing those who were worthy of managing the seven nations. The Seven questions were based on the 7 founders, Pride, Envy, Greed, Anger, Sloth, Gluttony, Lust. Voted by the people and elected by the people. A Empire was born.
