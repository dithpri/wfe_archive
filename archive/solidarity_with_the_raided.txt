[color=#5599ff]We are the [B]Solidarity with the Raided Moral Support Fleet[/B].[/color]

[color=#005500]We stand with regions that have been raided. We provide moral support.[/color]

[color=#ffcc00]We are not a defender organisation, as it is against our [B]peaceful policy[/B].[/color]
[color=green]However, we are, in the words of our nations, [nation=short+noflag]Anti-Bullying in NS[/nation], and we think that [nation=short+noflag]raiders should be ashamed of themselves[/nation], [nation=short+noflag]being ejected would be an honor[/nation], [nation=short+noflag]raiders will always lose[/nation], and we would [nation=short+noflag]never endorse a raider[/nation], even if we could.[/color]

[color=#5599ff][b]CURRENT MISSION:[/b]

from 0100 to 1400 UTC 080716.
Perform all settings changes.
Remain until notified (if you see that an invader region has launched a raid, please tell [nation=short]Home_Front Solidarity[/nation]).[/color]
