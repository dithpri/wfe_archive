At a time when interest in space exploration was growing around the world, the International Space Exploration Union has been established. Member states operate their own space exploration programs, and active co-development and exploration among the member countries is taking place. Members who dream of moving to the Moon, Mars and further to outer planets are developing a passion for space in their cooperation.
