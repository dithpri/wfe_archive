The mysterious Polynesian island jewel known as Tetiaroa is actually a 4.5 mile wide atoll comprised of 12 motus (small islands) and located just 36.5 miles (59 km) north of Papeete, the capital of French Polynesia on the island of Tahiti. 

It is probably most famously known for its now deceased but legendary owner, the charasmatic and moody Hollywood actor, Marlon Brando, although relatively few travelers have ever visited the place. (In actuality, Marlon didn&amp;#39;t ever really OWN the place, but rather was privy to a 99 year LEASE to it from the FP government.) &#151;tetiaroa.com
