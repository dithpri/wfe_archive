Welcome to New Sheoth. I&amp;#39;m your host, Sheogorath, Daedric Prince of Madness. We have a wonderful time here. Butterflies, Blood, Foxes, Severed Heads, hoho and the CHEESE!! To die for. Feel free to ask Haskill, or myself, or yourself, to get any questions answered. Send messages! A Song, A Summons, or A Death Threat written on the back of an Argonian Concubine! Those are my favorite.
