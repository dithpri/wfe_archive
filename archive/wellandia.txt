WELLANDIA
(Cooperative Network of Independent Republics)
[hr]
Wellandia, formally the Cooperative Network of Independent Republics (or CoNIR for short), is a region based on the legally binding Wellandia Agreement, which gives sole governmental authority to [nation]Djisland[/nation] to rule as necessary over the region in exchange for protection of all member nations. Wellandia is not a democracy, but rather a totalitarian autocracy, due to the inefficiencies and failures of democracy. Thus, if a Delegate is wrongfully elected, they will be immediately terminated and banjected, along with their voters.
