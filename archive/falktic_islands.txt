The Falktic island is a series of islands far spread apart from one another creating great diversity in climate and resources. The democracy of Blorjoirn was one of the first to settle these islands, choosing the more tropical and mountainous islands. Though many have still yet to be officially claimed the Blorjoirn government still says they have control over the regions and other nations may not settle them without documented, and explicit permission. Though, this may change.
