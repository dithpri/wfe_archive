Please join and endorse [nation]Unified Meritocracy[/nation]!
There are twelve spots in the government, not including Founder and WA Delegate. If you want to challenge someone for their position in the government, then send a telegram to [nation]Unified Meritocracy[/nation], who will set up a poll. Whoever scores higher in the poll gets that position in the government.
This means that [region]Bureaucracy United[/region] is an endless tangle of government, elections, and people, making it very fun to be in.
Hope you have a great time!
