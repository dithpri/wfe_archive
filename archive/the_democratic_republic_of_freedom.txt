The Democratic Republic of Freedom (or DRF) is a region that favour freedom and democracy, where everyone can have a say. We were formed so many newer and smaller players could [color=blue]grow and learn[/color] from more experienced players and that we could become a hub for democracy.

[b]So what has happened so far?[/b]
[*]We have currently had 2 WA delegates, [nation]Supremn[/nation] and [nation]Skundi[/nation]. [nation]Skundi[/nation] is currently the delegate though
[*]The DRF is allied with [region]The Eastern Union[/region], giving us protection for our nations if we are invaded. Diplomatically, our region has taken a step into the world stage!
[*] In our July elections, our next Prime Minister was set to be [nation]Matroyska[/nation], but in a quick turn of fate, both [nation]Supremn[/nation] and [nation]Pap Sculgief[/nation] gained two extra votes in the last two hours!
