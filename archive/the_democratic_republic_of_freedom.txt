The Democratic Republic of Freedom (or DRF) is a region that favour freedom and democracy, where everyone can have a say. We were formed so many newer and smaller players could [color=blue]grow and learn[/color] from more experienced players and that we could become a hub for democracy.

[b]So what has happened so far?[/b]
[*]We have currently had 2 WA delegates, [nation]Supremn[/nation] and [nation]Skundi[/nation]. [nation]Skundi[/nation] is currently the delegate though
[*]We have a thriving government so far, with an elected Prime Minister and 4 regional officers, who put their heart and soul into the region
[*]More people have started to arrive in our region thanks to Secretary of State, [nation]Supremn[/nation], managed to persuade 3 new nations to join the DRF. We hope that soon more nations can notice and join us.
