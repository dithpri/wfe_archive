The Democratic Republic of Freedom (or DRF) is a region that favours freedom and democracy, where everyone can have a say. We were formed so many newer and smaller players could [color=blue]grow and learn[/color] from more experienced players and that we could become a hub for democracy.

[b]So what has happened so far?[/b]
[*]The DRF is allied with [region]The Concord of Nations[/region], giving us protection for our nations if we are invaded. Diplomatically, our region has taken a step into the world stage!
[*] We are 19 days away from our 3rd General Election! Will [nation]Supremn[/nation] retain the position of Prime Minister, or will another nation take the top spot. I guess we&#39;re going to play a waiting game!
[*] Our Space Station RP is nearly underway, check out the RMB for info and the RP itself!
