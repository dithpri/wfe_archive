Regional Motto: Mildly Functional, Mildly Practical
Founded: 2nd May 2018

The DRF was a great region, at one point providing a home to more than 40 nations. However, in need of a new challenge, the DRF merged with Liberalia to form a new region. In memory of the greatness of the DRF, it will be left as a monument to remember all the good times it brought.
