The year is 2334. With the invention of reliable deep space travel came many wars over new territories. By this time, earth was low on material resources, such as rare metals. The United Nations still prevents countries from colonizing space, but says nothing about companies. Thus companies devised complex plans to terraform planets and start colonizing them in order to mine resources and ship them back. One such world is Kor10US (K class on route ten Unites States standard). However, Korious had no precious resources and was abandoned to form its own government on this isolated partially terraformed desert wasteland.
