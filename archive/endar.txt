This land is home to the free and the land of the brave. Our people may be simple, poor, sophisticated, or rich, but our ideals are one and the same.
We live to protect others from injustice, from hate, from oppression. 
All nations fall, but few truly live.
Here we seek to truly live out what it means to be a free and noble nation.
We no official religion, but most of our people are people of some kind of faith in a high power, whatever that may be.
Finally...

Strength through loyalty.

We stand loyally with one another and fear neither man nor beast as we grow, learn and develop as people, as nations.

Welcome to Endar, Home of the Free, Land of the Brave.
