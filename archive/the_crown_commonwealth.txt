The Crown Commonwealth is an alliance of nations led by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and the Isles. It was founded by the legendary King Maximus I, who&#146;s descendants now rule both the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth as kings. The Commonwealth stands for strict, monarchical rule and grand military might, as well as traditional values and Catholic spirituality. It also welcomes nations of all faiths, cultures and values, provided they swear allegiance to the crown. The Crown Commonwealth is undoubtedly the most powerful league of nations in the modern world, dominating politics, economy and military strength.
