[color=blue]Our region promotes democracy throughout the world - and raids regions a very odd way:
We block regional laws from being passed and implement our own laws.

It is heaps of fun and very annoying for the democratically raided region. We only need two WA Members in our region, for democratic raids can be done using mostly non-WA Members.

So why not come and join us? Imagine the fun - and power! We also have our own regional government - The Senate. However, any democratic raids in this regional government and the Secret Policeman will expel you![/color]
