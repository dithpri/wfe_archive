[color=pink]Welcome to Bin[/color][color=brown]gus Floppa Island![/color]

[i]This island has been historically divided by the factions of Bingus and Floppa; Pick a side! Will you hike across the Bingus Heights or have a boat voyage on the Floppa Swamps, or just be a plain, boring neutral who stays at home all day playing weird games on the phone?[/i]

In the heart of our vibrant region, an age-old conflict unfolds between the valiant Bingus and the resilient Floppa. This enduring rivalry shapes our land, where each citizen passionately supports one side in the quest for dominance, or is just a pathetic neuter. Choose your allegiance, and participate in the government!
