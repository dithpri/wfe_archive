[b][u]General Rules:[/u][/b]

Anarchy is allowed, but PLEASE be Ancap (Anarcho-Capitalist) if you must
The Hill Empirean Assembly is a region for ALL nations. We just [b]STRONGLY[/b] recommend that you are (even slightly) [i]capitalist[/i].

[b][u]Military Rules:[/u][/b]

Each nation in The Hill Empirean Assembly is [u]required[/u] to make a factbook titled &quot;Our Current Navy&quot; or any variation of it (we&#39;re creating an assembly-wide shared military)
You may add up the amount of days your nation has been around (those will be your points). You may spend points on new ships (list will be in a doc. titled &quot;Navy Shop&quot;). You may name ships whatever you want, just nothing obscene (swearing, body parts ect).
