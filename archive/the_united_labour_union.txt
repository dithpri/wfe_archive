[b]The United Labor Union Code of Allegiance:[/b]

[i]&quot;We shall fight for the common man, the single mothers, the lonely children, and we shall fight for their place in society, and the world. We shall fight for equality amongst all, because ever man, woman, and child were born equal. We shall fight for our workers, for they turn the wheels of society, and now, they turn the wheels of the future&quot;[/i]

[b]Join and fight for these things, and so much more[/b]
