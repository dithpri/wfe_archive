Siberia is extraordinarily rich in minerals, containing ores of almost all economically valuable metals largely because of the absence of Quaternary glaciation outside highland areas. It has some of the world&amp;#39;s largest deposits of nickel, gold, lead, coal, molybdenum, gypsum, diamonds, diopside, silver and zinc, as well as extensive unexploited resources of oil and natural gas.
