A council of nations dedicated to invading dishonorable and tyrannical regions for the purpose of setting up democracies and libertarian governments.

Join only if you:

A. Wish to be a part of invader gameplay.
B. Wish to join the World Assembly. If you do not, you will be removed from the Council.
C. Are dedicated to libertariansim and do not embrace extreme left or right wing ideologies. Nations found to have fascist or communist governments, or that have a general disregard for human rights, will be removed from the Council.

If you want to fight for freedom, please join and have a good time!
