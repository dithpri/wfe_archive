In The Alliance of Arabian Socotra, we do not judge based on what type of government someone is. We are located in the Arabian Sea, with the island countries of Bamaki Muoli and Adorocco being the administration of the region. The Fiefdom of Bamaki Muoli is our Founder and WA Delegate, while the Allied States of Adorocco is the Vice-Delegate. We currently are looking for members, and are a public region. There are still offices open, so if you join you must prove your loyalty to us before you get appointed to an office. We believe in freedom and at the same time a good economy. Good luck governing your nation, whatever it may be!
