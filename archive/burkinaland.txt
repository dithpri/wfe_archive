&amp;quot;My own backyard. I own this place and all of its inhabitants,&amp;quot; says the benevolent Queso Grande of ISOuaga. The Great Leader, the all-knowing, omnipresent and omnipotent High Priest of the Cult of the Queso Grande cares for all his children...as long as they don&amp;#39;t piss him off. Then they tend to disappear. Defy the Cheesy High Priest at your own peril. Cracked-out dragons are severely persecuted and rightly turned into haute coutre shoes and sold at an outrageous mark-up to shallow fashionistas.
