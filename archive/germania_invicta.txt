It is the first century, only several years after the death and resurrection of Christ. The warring German tribes of Antiquity have united, and severely repelled the Roman advance into Germania at the Varian Disaster. Instead of slaughtering all of Roman troops, many surrendered, and several legions and virtually all of the auxiliary troops were annexed into the burgeoning Germanic forces. Will Rome finally prevail? Or will the Germans found a mighty Empire of their own? 

[region]Germania Invicta[/region] is an eclectic Germanic/Roman alternate history themed region, based on the unsteady union of the Cherusci, Marsi, Chatti, Bructeri, Angrivarii, Chauci and Sicambri during the Varian War.
