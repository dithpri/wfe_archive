Veraken is a rather small region off the coast of Scandinavia. The region is very diverse in religion. It is rather cold but can be very warm during summer months. Also, for four weeks of the year, the sun doesn&amp;#39;t raise. This is known as the &amp;#39;Midwinter Blackness&amp;#39;. Veraken is probably most famous for it&amp;#39;s pagan religions that became discontinued in the 18th century.
