[color=Teal]Welcome to Whahyck!

As the name suggests, this is wack!
We are a simple region that spans from Russia to Korea.

Our region is a WIP.

Everyone is welcome to join our region! We are in the process of creating a Constitution. If you would like to view the rough draft, you can request a copy through our Communications Officer.

For now we are doing a regional vote for embassy construction, so if you would like to construct an embassy with us, feel free to ask! When we have requirements for embassies we will give notice. All embassies previously constructed will not be effected by our legislation.

Best Regards,
