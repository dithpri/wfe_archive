Welcome to the Empire under the stars! 
This is another region for hbw in case you don&#39;t want to join Kirkar.
Peace, love, and cheesecake. Cheesecake is awesome.


EDIT: there&#39;s been some argument recently. Just calm down people. From now on, I&#39;ll make sure to try and keep arguing to a minimum, but there&#39;s only so much I can do. Guys, I&#39;m looking to you guys to help me with that. 

Edit: tired of being complained to. Ask Chris for permissions. He has executive.
 Don&#39;t ask me. The complaints pile up and there really no way for me to make everyone happy. Any questions: ask Chris. (And please don&#39;t complain about not complaining, it makes me feel worse)
