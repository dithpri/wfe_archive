Mecca is the birthplace of Muhammad. The Hira cave atop the Jabal al-Nur (&quot;Mountain of Light&quot;) is just outside the city and is where Muslims believe the Quran was first revealed to Muhammad.[4] Visiting Mecca for the Hajj is an obligation upon all able Muslims. The Great Mosque of Mecca, known as the Masjid al-Haram, is home to the Ka&#39;bah, believed by Muslims to have been built by Abraham and Ishmael, is one of Islam&#39;s holiest sites and the direction of prayer for all Muslims (qibla), cementing Mecca&#39;s significance in Islam.[5]
