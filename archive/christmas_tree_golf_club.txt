[color=scarlet]Greetings, all nations!
Merry Christmas &amp; peace be with you.

Welcome to a calm &amp; tranquil place to play a leisurely round of golf. Professional or amateur, it doesn&#146;t matter. Take your time, relax in the fresh air, &amp; enjoy the best sport in the world.

While you&#146;re here, spend some quiet moments in our world-renowned clubhouse that combines 18th century Vienna with early 20th century (1900-1950) America to create a unique style all its own.

Besides playing golf, we also look forward to selling traditional Christmas trees in the golfing offseason of November &amp; December each year when the grounds crew is busy getting everything ready for the new golfing season in the Spring.
