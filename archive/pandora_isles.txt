[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] went out to prove that we are not the big stupid, but that we are the big smart! And prove it they did! While the Mad King sang them on, the Hawks were able to knock out some targets. While SGT [nation]Drexlore[/nation]&#39;s Codec crashed, he was still able to salvage the operation and find those perfect regions!
