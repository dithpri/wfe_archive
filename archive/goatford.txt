Marineford was the island of the base of operations for Marine Headquarters,[2] where now the Marine Base G-1 is situated. It is where former Fleet Admiral Sengoku and the admirals resided, along with many vice admirals and lower officers when they were not assigned to another base. The city surrounding Marineford was inhabited by the families of Marine soldiers.[3]

It is situated near the Sabaody Archipelago, and laid directly next to Mary Geoise on the Red Line. The only safe way to reach Marineford is through the Gates of Justice.
