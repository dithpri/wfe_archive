This Region is epic, The End.
You want more? Okay well here you go:
---
-Do whatever you want but don&#39;t be a jackass
-We have coolness points, you need them. Why do you need them? &#39;Cuz they&#39;re totally Rad!
-Wtf do coolness points do? You must acquire coolness points to achieve ultimate coolness &amp; out-cool Other Nations, but more coolness means other regions get jealous
-Fighting Forces? Either be strong or cool, only a fool attempts to be both but if you can pull it off then you may achieve a Legend Point.
-What&#39;re legend points? Max Level Coolness points. (Or just be rich, no LP&#39;s tho)
-Have pride in your nation.
-Maple Syrup
