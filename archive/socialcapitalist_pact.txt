Greetings, wandering nations! I see you have stumbled upon my magnificent region, the Socialcapitalist Pact! This regions name represents the two types of governments, capitalism and socialism. As you can see, this is a very abnormal mix of two types of governments, so you my think it won&#39;t work very well together, so it will collapse. If you thought that, then you are completely incorrect! There will be two types of governments in the region, one will be socialist and will support the poverty and help them to at least get a job and affordable shelter, while the capitalist government will support major corporations and deal with importing and exporting with other regions and lone nations, therefore making the perfect region!
