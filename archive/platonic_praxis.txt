Praxis is the process by which a theory, lesson, or skill is enacted, practiced, embodied, or realized. Praxis also refers to the act of engaging, applying, exercising, realizing, or practicing ideas.

The nations of Praxis are committed to creating a highly technological, intellectual and socially advance civilization focused on space exploration and developing technology that will improve the quality of life for all cognitive life in the universe. 

Currently, the allies of Platonic praxis are rolling out an advance science driver program and developing and refining large desposites of Prometheium (found in New Ontogeny) and Techneium Found and Amazonia Pearl) to create new forms of rocket fuel to colonize the moon and mars.
