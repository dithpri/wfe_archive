We are creating a scientifically advance region focused on space exploration &amp;amp; developing technology that will improve the quality of life for all cognitive life in the universe. We believe progress is not defined by a linear or arbitrary amount of increase of wealth. All human activity must be driven by challenges to the frontiers of human knowledge, &amp;amp; must always aim toward achieving a Fusion-Powered Economy. Man&#146;s power to harness the processes of the Sun is not only an emerging reality, it is in fact a existential necessity. We must now direct our resources towards achieving critical breakthroughs in the domain of thermonuclear processes, which can be limitless power.
