[i][color=silver]TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM
Take a newspaper.
Take some scissors.
Choose an article the length you want to make your poem.
Cut out the article.
Cut out each of the words, put them all in a bag.
Shake gently.
Next take out each cutting one after the other.
Copy conscientiously in the order in which they left the bag.
The poem will resemble you.
