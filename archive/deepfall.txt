Welcome to the region of [color=purple][B]Deepfall[/B][/color], a primarily [color=blue][B]Role-Playing[/B][/color] region which has multiple RPs you could partake in. We had a &quot;main&quot; universe which every RP after is a effect, or something compeltely random.
But due to a loss of a Fellow Main RolePlayer We are currently using a different RP.

One last fact. If you want to rp with one of us. Look for the  &quot;Main RPer&quot;
We usually have active members at random times of the day. So you can RP with us.

[color=blue][B]DeepfallJukebox[/B][/color] it cna support Five Songs. Which cna be any genre. But new warned.
A song or two will for sure cause a [color=red][B]EarPleasure[/B][/color]
