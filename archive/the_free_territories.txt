[b]Welcome![/b]

The Free Territories is a land where all nations are welcome to come and feud with one another, the only thing uniting them being a dislike of strict authority and a love of good RP. This region aims to be one where people of conflicting beliefs can come and reside with each other, free to agree and disagree as they please, crafting RPs, and enjoying the spirit of freedom.

The Region is in the process of writing a bill of rights, so if you&#39;d like yo help join our [url=https://discord.gg/DGgfVZq] Discord [/url]

Things are presently under construction in regards to format, so please be generous when you look upon the region&#39;s present organization.

Please do stick around if you want see how things will develop.
