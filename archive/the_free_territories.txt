[b]Death! To all who stand in the way of freedom for working people![/b]  

We are the free territories, open to all regardless of ideology or belief.  We are Anarchists and freedom of speech and freedom of belief is encouraged.  We have now rules other then ToS and all are welcome to stay.  We aim on creating a large community with a role play, and eventually a server on discord, but for now we&#39;re just a group of people who believe All is for All :).  For now my friends, To the Barricades! We shall defend freedom for all and we shall dismantle the unjust hierarchies forced upon us, and united we shall crush all who try to undermine us! For we, of the [region]The Free Territories[/region] shall bow to no one.
