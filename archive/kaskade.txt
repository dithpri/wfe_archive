[b][color=blue]Welcome to the [/color][color=black] Kaskade.[/color][/b]

[b]Kaskade[/b] is as much a roleplay as it is a joint storytelling and lore experience. In the aftermath of the [b]Kaskade[/b], the end of the modern nationstate as we know it, the undead having risen in the masses, [b]Kaskade[/b] is a story about the slow, painful, rebuilding of civilization, and the path forward. It is a story of the will, and the prospects for humanity, after it&#39;s untimely demise. How will you carve out a piece of history? Time will tell.
