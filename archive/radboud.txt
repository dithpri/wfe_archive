Radboud is a region specially made for people associated with the Radboud University of Nymegen. The rules are simple:
- Grow in popularity and make up the rules using your influence.
Additional rules:
- Do not bitch about the rules
- Suggestions are always welcome, but there is a good change they will be ignored
- There is a forum associated with this region: [url=http://z13.invisionfree.com/radboud/index.php?act=idx]HERE[/url]
- Want to get in this region? Introduce yourself [url=http://z13.invisionfree.com/radboud/index.php?act=idx]THERE[/url]. It&amp;#39;s probably a good idea to PM someone, because it&amp;#39;s not visited that often
- Giving me a good reason why you should be in this region gives you a good chance in not-getting-randomly-kicked. Endorsement is always a good reason not to get kicked.
- Have fun
