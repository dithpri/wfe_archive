[b]Here stands the Tavern[/b]

Weary traveler, come sit by the [color=red]f[/color][color=orange]ir[/color][color=yellow]e[/color] and warm your hands. All can stay. Get a room, and stay and visit, or be out before dawn. Meet others and talk, or observe and listen. We welcome all, and all are welcome to a chair by the fire to sit and listen to other people speak, or speak themeselves.

Stay for a day or two, or maybe make this your home. 

[b]The Tavern is open[/b]
