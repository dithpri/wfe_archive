[b]Founded on 4.5.2022 by [nation]Markus Sarasti-Varis[/nation][/b], [i]formerly known as one of the foremost voices and representatives of Fascism on NationStates[/i], [b][region]The New Social Movement[/region] and its dedicated Member-Advocates represent a philosophical community and a &quot;civil religion&quot; which is foundationally anti-ideological, anti-political and anti-party.[/b] 

&amp;gt; [u]Our aspirations for the establishment of a positive cooperative regime of unity and order, what we propose as the [color=orange]DemoOrganic Civic State[/color], is firmly embedded in the vision and design of the original [color=green]New Total Society Theory[/color][/u], authored by [nation]Markus Sarasti-Varis[/nation], which is based on the exaltation of pure national-revolutionary spirit and ambition, and the values of humanity, balance and dynamism.
