[b][region]The New Social Movement[/region] [NSM] is founded upon the premise and doctrinal framework of the [i]&#147;New Total Society Theory&#148; [/i][NTST], which is an original creation formulated and visioned by the Cancellarius of the NSM, [nation]Markus Sarasti-Varis[/nation][/b]. This theory is an extrapolation and a positivistic, contemporary, re-interpretation of Fascist-Totalitarian philosophies. At the basis of the NTST lies the three interwoven [i]&quot;critical insights[/i]&quot;, which give a structural framework and need for the relevancy and propagation of the NTST. These are, as specified in-detail in the attached explanatory-document:

[u]1. The constructive need to build a new tradition.

2. The fundamental need to denounce Nazism.

3. The integral need to move beyond politics.[/u]
