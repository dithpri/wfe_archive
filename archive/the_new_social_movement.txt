[b]Founded on 4.5.2022 by [nation]Markus Sarasti-Varis[/nation],[i] formerly known as one of the most influential and foremost representatives / voices of Fascism on NationStates[/i], [region]The New Social Movement[/region] [NSM] embodies the personal aspirations of its Member-Advocates in safeguarding the continued future and honor of the national-revolutionary spirit in our challenging 21st century globalist sociopolitical environment.[/b] 

&amp;gt; Our collective struggle is built upon the premise and doctrinal framework of the [color=green]New Total Society Theory[/color], as shown to us by the vision and design of [nation]Markus Sarasti-Varis[/nation].

&amp;gt; We source example and inspiration from Fascism, [u]but consider ourselves uniquely distinct and separate from its tradition[/u]. We do not condone hateful or prejudiced rhetoric.
