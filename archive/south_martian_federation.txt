Hello, I&#39;m [nation]Lyot Crater[/nation] the founder and current president of The [region]South Martian Federation[/region] We are a Mars/Space roleplay region. If your nation does not have a space programme you must choose a proxy who can transport citizens between Mars and Earth. If you don&#39;t do this or lose your current proxy, your territory will be removed within 20 days. A map can be found on our discord https://discord.gg/kEeNxCG. Legislation is passed through the poll system and we hold democratic elections every month, you can start parties by requesting it on our discord.
