[b][u]South Martian Federation[/u][/b]

We are a roleplay region dedicated to the democratic and aggressive take over of South Mars, we accept both Earther and Martian states into the region. We hold elections every 2 months where parties created by members battle it out, the libertarian party is currently in control but in the past, we had an anarchy party which (ironically) fell apart. Feel free to message me on discord or send a telegram about creating a party.
