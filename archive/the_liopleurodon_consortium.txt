The Liopleurodon Consortium was founded in 1978 in the center of the South Atlantic Ocean. It was founded when James Wesley of the hyperspace planning committee fell out of his cruiser and met the incredibly dull citizens of its now-member nations. They were all besieged by the cruel surrounding nations, whose relentless attacks knew no end. James, alongside pioneer Pierre Knotyerrin, threw coconuts at the attacking nations and built a nice cozy treehouse to hang out in, complete with a &amp;quot;No Cooties Allowed&amp;quot; sign.
