[hr]Nature&#39;s first green is gold, 
Her hardest hue to hold. 
Her early leafs a flower; 
But only so an hour. 
Then leaf subsides to leaf. 
So Eden sank to grief, 
So dawn goes down to day. 
Nothing gold can stay.

Every bull market, every boom, every period of prosperity and invincibility, it must end.

[region]Novus Universale[/region] has fallen. Shall we help to bring it back up?
