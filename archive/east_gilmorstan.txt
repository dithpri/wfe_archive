East Gilmorstan was founded by the glorious nation of Miristak in 2018. That doesn&#39;t mean anything right now, but in like, 5 years that&#39;d be pretty good. Probably. Anyways East Gilmorstan is a region built for anyone. Violent dictatorship? Come on in! Free loving democracy? Let me take your coat! Banana Republic? Get over here! This region is here to be a beautiful example of what a handful of trash nations can do when they work together!
