The RIF was once a land known as &quot;Canada&quot; but due to a historical event in the world led to nations falling apart, countries and nations that once fell into nothing, Canada being one of them. New nations came out and formed the RIF. With the leading nation being the Commonwealth of Imperial Cana. The land has been split up between every nation that inters the RIF, and to get on the map is easy, just ask Imperial Cana to get added once you join. 

I hope you enjoy yer stay in the Region of Imperial Families!
