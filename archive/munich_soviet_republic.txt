The Bavarian Soviet Republic, also known as the Munich Soviet Republic was a short-lived unrecognised socialist state in Bavaria during the German Revolution of 1918&#150;1919. It took the form of a workers&#39; council republic. Its name is also sometimes rendered in English as the Bavarian Council Republic; the German term R&auml;terepublik means a republic of councils or committees, and council or committee is also the meaning of the Russian word soviet. It was established in April 1919 after the demise of Kurt Eisner&#39;s government and sought to establish a socialist republic in Bavaria. It was overthrown less than a month later by elements of the German Army and the paramilitary Freikorps.
