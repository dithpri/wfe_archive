I came across this old region which used to be a puppet storage of the now defunct [region]UCR[/region] (Union of Cooperative Republics). It was under the ownership of several other belligerents over the past few years, including [region]BLITZKRIEG[/region] and [region]USSF[/region]. None of those goons matter now as this little relic is mine now. [b][i][color=blue]Thanks for letting it CTE.[/color][/i][/b]
