[b]Background[/b]

The Northern Sea is a vast, icy ocean, where cold winds whip across endless waves. Icebergs drift through the freezing waters, and thick fog often covers the horizon. Long ago, nations marched like 
us among the mighty sea, growing to what we stand for today. Unity.

Together, we will make our voices heard on the stage of the World!

More positions are opening soon, keep on the lookout for a telegram containing applications.
