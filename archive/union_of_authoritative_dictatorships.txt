The Union of Authoritative Dictatorships, also known as the U.A.D., is a region that is for all the countries that rule their citizens with an iron fist. It is for the countries that understand that true progress can only come with order, structure, and unity, and the countries that understand that civil rights and political freedoms are worthless. The only thing that matters to the U.A.D is the strength of the military, and the strength of the economy.
