Welcome to the Suinnine Union!

We are a democratic region, however we are an open democracy, where all laws and documents will be voted on via pool in the regional page. However, whoever is the delegate will still have power as they are the one who proposes bills in the first place and represents us in the world assembly.

WA Endorsement Cap: [b]5[/b] (due to increase as regional population does)

[b]NOTE: We are not holding elections until the end of January to give us time to grow. Please endorse the [nation]Suinnium[/nation] instead.[/b]
