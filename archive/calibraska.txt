An unnamed tribe migrated from The North Pacific to what is now the Calibraska mainland at least 20,000 years ago with West Pacific colonization beginning in the 16th century. Calibraska emerged from 4 Western Pacific colonies located along the East Coast. Disputes between west Pacific and the colonies led to a Revolution that lasted for 12 years.
