Calibraska was a peaceful region until one day the evil country of [nation=long]Vernarnia[/nation] of [region]The Edge Union[/region] invaded and took over. Shortly After, The Edge Union tried Vernarnia in court and bared them from colonizing again but, Vernarnia wouldn&amp;#39;t listen and kept Calibraska as a colony. Then things went from bad to worse as The [region]Mafia[/region] of [region]Equinox[/region] took over Vernarnia&amp;#39;s Annexed Region and tried to Deregionize Calibraska. Until the great nation of [nation=long]The Church of Bayside[/nation] of [region]Bayside Church[/region] swooped in and saved Calibraska and their Identity. The nation&amp;#39;s of Calibraska voted democratically to be a colony of Bayside.
