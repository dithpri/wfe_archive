The &#147;Financial Protectorate of Graphixe&#148; is a regional alliance composed of mid-sized islands in the northern Borealian Ocean of The World. The region&#146;s inhabitants are not related to each other through ancestry. It is thought that the islands were originally inhabited only by the natives living there, who went on to develop the three Capitalist states in the region. However, Intelligist Antarctica was founded in the 5th Century AD in The World, by civilians fleeing the sack of a northern province of The Etruscan Empire.
