We are a group of like minded people eager to accomplish civil rights and liberties for all law abiding citizens. We strive for low-cost health care, education, and lifestyles to promote equality for our citizens within the confines of our countries and on a worldwide scale. 
The Civil Union is a democratic group who support governments, workers, and our citizens through education, safety, health, and criminal reforms to soon form the perfect, ideal union. By adding members to our region, we can further promote democracy and fight for global liberties like equality and civil rights.
