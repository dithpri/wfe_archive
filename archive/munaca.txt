A huge lush region filled with many tropical jungles and exotic geographic sites. Munaca is filled with many small tribes and nations. The region is managed and keeps up with the rest of the world through Sagerism. The region is led by Empress Alisson H Ruinezo. The flag is compromised of two of the most influential and dominant nations in Munaca. To create an equal balance in the region, every certified nation has a representative in the Regional Council (RC). Sagerism is not permitted to have any representatives as the head of the region is led by it&amp;#39;s ruler. South Laozi has the ability to send 3 representatives.
