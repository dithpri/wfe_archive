The [color=red]Final International of Communist Revolutionaries[/color] has been created by the [color=red]Chairman of the Communist Party of East Asia[/color] ([color=red]CPEA[/color]), with a vision to liberate all regions from the tyranny of [color=blue]Capitalism[/color] and [color=brown]Fascism[/color].

We accept all [color=red]Communist[/color] nations that adhere to one of the five approved forms of [color=red]Communism[/color] ([color=red]Marxism[/color], [color=red]Leninism[/color], [color=red]Marxism-Leninism[/color], [color=red]Stalinism[/color], [color=red]Maoism[/color]), as they will naturally be a friend of the [color=red]Revolution[/color] - our regionwide liberation movement.

Let us finish what [color=red]Comrade Lenin[/color] started.

- [color=red]The Executive Committee of the Final International[/color]
