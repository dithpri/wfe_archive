[hr][i][b][color=red]&amp;#39;twas a day in October and all through the region[/color]
 [color=black]corporations were trembling despite the warm season[/color]
 [color=red]with a founder gone AWOL they huddled in fear[/color]
[color=black] they yelped and they cursed and they cried bitter tears[/color]
 [color=red]as the clock went on ticking they wept and they moaned[/color]
 [color=black]with hate in their hearts and with shame in their bones[/color]
[color=red] they jabbered and yammered as justice closed in[/color]
 [color=black]the time would soon come when they&amp;#39;d pay for their sins[/i][/color]
