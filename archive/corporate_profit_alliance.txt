Welcome to the CPA! A place for free market nations to gather, chill out, and trade liberally. If your legislature debates balance sheets instead of social policies, and thinks &amp;#39;bills&amp;#39; are the tab for a night out, you&amp;#39;re in the right place!

[b]If you are a member of the World Assembley[/b] please endorse our Regional Delegate [nation]The Cousins Bellic[/nation]

Direct all inquiries regarding the CPA to the Regional Delegate, or feel free to post a message on the regional board.

We hope you enjoy your time in this Capitalist playground and wish you and your nation a prosperous existance.
