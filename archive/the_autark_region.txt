Instead of getting dictations by the dictatorship of the World Assembly majority, the countries in the Autark Region decided they wanted 100% self control.
Of course there is some bilateral activity, but only to benefit both countries, but there will be no interference in domestic policies (with sometimes very different political systems) . In a case of interference...well...words can solve any problem in The Autark Region...and if necessary, so can swords...
