Global Union of Socialist Peoples is a co-operative community looking to create a bottom-up government rather than top-down. This is a haven for socialists, anarchists, communists, progressives, social democrats, democratic socialists, religious socialists, pacifists and environmentalists. The noble aim I call you for is to have a part in the creation of a new power on the Left, a chance to make history, make friends, and join our community. Thank you for reading and have a blessed day brother or sister!
