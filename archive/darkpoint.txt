[b]Overview[/b]
A world where the Cold War still rages on in the truest form, where the United States collapsed in 1962, and where entire countries are run by cult-like communist &quot;governments&quot;, there are endless possibilities. Whether you are a staunch, right-wing dictatorship, or a liberal communist hellscape, you can find a place in Darkpoint. 

[b]Map[/b]
Below is a world map with borders. Feel free to edit it by adding your country. If you need to add or subtract land, do so. If you and another nation have a dispute over an area of land, an Officer can roll a die, and the highest roll invades the other nation(s). The victor can either force the others to relocate, or leave them with however much land they wish.
