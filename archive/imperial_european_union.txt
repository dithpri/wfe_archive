[u][b]WELCOME![/b][/u]
Please endorse our WA delegate, [nation]Prussenia[/nation]
[u]The regional RP[/u]
The map is pinned below.

When you join the map, you can choose to either opt in or out of war. [b]THIS CANNOT BE CHANGED![/b]*
Opt out: You are not permitted to start wars but nobody can declare war on you.
Opt in: You are permitted to start wars but people are permitted to declare war on you.

Godmodding (Being unrealistically powerful) will first be a warning and second be a final warning and on 3rd offense, ban.

All roleplay will relate to the map.

If an invasion occurs, i will update the map when the war completes.
Also, be realistic with invasions. (E.g: If you&#39;re landlocked, don&#39;t invade countries you don&#39;t border.)
