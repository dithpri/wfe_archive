With the fall of capitalism at hand, the world will see a new, capitalist free, kebab free alliance. We may be somewhat small right now, but we will expand to a bright, and beautiful Republic, with a great future, and an iron fist.

Where there is a will, there is a way, when there is a way, we will rise.
All for one
One for all
For the good of all men.
