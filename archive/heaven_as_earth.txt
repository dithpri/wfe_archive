[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] went out with some younglings to see the sights!

[color=aqua]We did some loops, twirled around a bit, and practiced our skills in your region![/color]

After doing all that tiring exercise, we decided to hang out and have a quick cookie that you took from your cookie jar before heading back!
