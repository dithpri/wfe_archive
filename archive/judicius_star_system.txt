This Star System plays host to the founding and capital planet of the Court Justicars, Raincrious. Raincrious is a planet entirely made of one Supreme Megacity that surrounds the Court Capital.

The Court Capital is composed of the central Warden&#39;s Cathedral surrounded by the Council&#39;s Supreme Inquisition, the First College of Sorcery, Channeling and Wizardry, and the Watchtower of the Warden&#39;s Hand.

This Capital is where the Court Justicars full authority resides.
