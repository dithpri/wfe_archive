We are rebuilding from a plague of locusts, so our region is currently closed to new nations. We will reopen our borders at such time as the damage has been corrected and all invaders have been removed.

Any defenders who were banned from The West by The Black Hawks during their invasion may telegram the WA Delegate with a request for reinstatement. I have no wish to exclude from our region those who would defend it.
