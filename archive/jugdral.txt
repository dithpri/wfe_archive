Gaps exist in the record, however, it is shown that when Loptyr entered the body of Bishop Galle, the Lopto Sect formed, overthrowing Gran and establishing a brutal empire. The following years saw much suffering. In 611, a Liberation Army formed. By 632, there were only 12 left, and the gods descended to them, each blood-bonding with one fighter. These became the Twelve Crusaders, and by 648, they had overthrown the Lopto Empire. Peace came about, until the Lopto Sect crawled out from the underground. By 776, a new Liberation Army had formed, led by Celice, a descendant of Baldo. With his divine sword Tyrfing and his allies, Emperor Alvis and his son Julius, Loptyr&#39;s vessel, were defeated, and New Grannvale was formed.
