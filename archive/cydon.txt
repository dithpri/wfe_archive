Cydon is a region on the planet Mars. The area borders the plains of Acidalia Planitia and the Arabia Terra highlands. The area includes the regions: &quot;Cydon Mensae&quot;, an area of flat-topped mesa-like features, &quot;Cydon Colles&quot;, a region of small hills or knobs, and &quot;Cydon Labyrinthus&quot;, a complex of intersecting valleys. Cydon lies in the planet&#39;s northern hemisphere in a transitional zone between the heavily cratered regions to the south and relatively smooth plains to the north. Some planetologists believe that the northern plains may once have been ocean beds, and that Cydon may once have been a coastal zone.
