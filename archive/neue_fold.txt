Welcome to this new version of Earth, feel free to join!

Monarchies most welcome, but everyone can join if the wish (even your puppets, but I prefer they are active/alive).

Currently, the whole world is available for the taking except the following regions:

-All the territories covered by the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy (me, the Founder), which will slowly over time grow.

-Occitania (including Val d&amp;#39;Aran, Andorra, Monaco, the Occitan bits of Switzerland and Italy).

No spamming and acting like a moron please, you shall be given three warnings, at the third one, you shall be ejected.

Region may gain password protection in the future.
