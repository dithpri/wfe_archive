I regret to inform everyone that Radioactive Wastelands will go into stricter Rules.

1. WA Delegates will not have power (to prevent invaders)
2. If you are apart of the Black Riders or any any other Invading group you will be band.
3. If you want to make embassies with another region just ask.
4. As long as you follow these you will be fine.
