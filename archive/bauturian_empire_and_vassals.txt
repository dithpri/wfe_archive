The Bauturian Empire was founded in 967 by Bautur the brave. The Empire has a emperor who rules over many nations and provinces. All nations hail to the empire but are allowed to make their own laws and policies as long as they don&#39;t hinder the empire&#39;s goals. The Empire is a warlike nation and pacifism is not tolerated. When the time comes, by Jingo we&#39;ll fight!
