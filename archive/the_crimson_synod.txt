Behold The Crimson Synod, a zealous covenant, consecrated in faith and sanctified by conquest. Though newly wrought and few in number, we burn with unyielding zeal and seek ever to grow in dreadful glory.

Ours is the holy hunt: to scourge the unbeliever and bring low the nations that spurn the Word. Join us, if thy spirit be steadfast&#133; and happy hunting!
