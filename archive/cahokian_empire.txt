The lands of Cahokia have been forgotten by most, now a new land appears in the distance. It is a shining land of wealth and of forgotten antiquity, come to conquer the former world once more. All lands are Cahokia, all will fall before it&amp;#39;s inalienable right to rule the worlds.

Rule Cahokia!



&amp;quot;Thus the prophecy of a new world was set in stone and ordained by the Ravens&amp;quot;
-Book of the Empire: 1:2
