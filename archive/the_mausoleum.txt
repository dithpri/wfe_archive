Welcome to [region]The Mausoleum[/region].
Please speak in soft respectful tones.

This is intended as a place where the ceased to exist, and the disgraced, may be simply remembered. The remembrance may take any form, from a poem, to a quotation, or a brief tribute.

The sick and dying nations should still find their way to [region]The Graveyard[/region], [region]Graveyard[/region], [region]The Boneyard[/region], [region]Boneyard[/region], [region]The Cemetery[/region], [region]Cemetery[/region], the [region]Hall of Mourning[/region], or to any similar region which is less morbid. Silent meditation and contemplation are preferred here.
