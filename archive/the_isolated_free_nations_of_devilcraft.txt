The Isolated Free Nations of Devilcraft is a region free from atheist and big religions dogmas. Our members are all states that encourage the practice of witchcraft, devil worship, animist sorcery, generic dark arts and much other evil doings! However, there is one ban on one type of magic: No necromancy is to be tolerated and members which are caught to have undead, therefore necromancers will be immediately expelled.
