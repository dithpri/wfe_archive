The year is 2122.

50 years ago WWIII broke out, and the resulting nuclear exchange has left most of the northern hemisphere uninhabitable. Even in those lucky lands that were spared direct irradiation, the collapse of the global order was felt in a corresponding total collapse of social order. No country escaped the effects of Armageddon, and what civilisation survives does so only in isolated pockets; islands in a sea of anomie.

Now, in a Southern Africa totally cut off from the other inhabitable zones of a world torn apart, those isolated pockets begin, at last, to consolidate. A new world rises Phoenix-like from the ashes of the old.
