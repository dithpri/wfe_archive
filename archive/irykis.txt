Irykis is a collection of nations created by one person. They originated as a set of nations in a fantasy world, and the creator (i.e. me) thought it would be fun to make each one on NationStates and see what happens.

This is a private group purely for personal amusement and convenience, and therefore does not admit any foreign nations.
