Part of the [region]Imperial Galactic Republic of Andarios[/region]! The capital of the Federation was originally Celticos, but after the devastation of 3418, the last ruling bodies of the sector moved to Celtica. There the remaining government surrendered and Celtica was allowed to keep the name Celtic Kingdoms and instead of Celtica, the planet is known in that way.
