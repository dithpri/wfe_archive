The Community of [nation]Knica Eas[/nation] emerged from isolation, only to find themselves overwhelmed by the noises of the external world. Thus, the Community collected the advancements made and found a way back to their little corner of the world. 

If you somehow chance upon [region]Tranquility[/region], Knica Easians would see it as a happy quirk of fate. Please feel free to observe and leave, or to stay and chat.
