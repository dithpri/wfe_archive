A little known region in the middle of the ocean, this area has immense resources and greatly values a comprehensive blend of economic advancement and environmental conservation. The region supports the right of self-determination for all nations and their citizens. The promotion of trade and dialogue between member nations is encouraged, but not necessary, and the hope is that we can bring change to the World Assembly and reflect our ideals across all regional and sovereign governments.
