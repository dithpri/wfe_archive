The 1970s was a decade that began on January 1, 1970, and ended on December 31, 1979. In the 21st century, historians have increasingly portrayed the 1970s as a &quot;pivot of change&quot; in world history, focusing especially on the economic upheavals that followed the end of the postwar economic boom.
Glory the 70s!
