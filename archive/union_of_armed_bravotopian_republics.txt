The Union of Armed Bravotopian Republics (UABR) also known as The Bravotopian Union, is a small alliance of nations bound together in economic, legislative, humanitarian and most importantly, military ties, under the federative administration of The Armed Republic of Bravotopia.

All nations under the UABR are pro-military and prioritises the religional security above all else. An attack on one is an attack on all, the UABR is not shy of engaging any foreign power who threatens any of its members.

The UABR was founded to strengthen religional security and resist foreign aggression from neighbouring regions, fighting through countless bloody wars of independence.
