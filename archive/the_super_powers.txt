[b]Here we have powerful nations that are accepted by[/b] [color=red]Far-Right[/color] [b]ideologies and are not accepted by liberalisms and communisms. Nations are subject to the laws of the region and we deal with the political and economic issues of the world together and everyone has their own duties and everyone must be loyal to the leader and officers.[/b]

[b]Be loyal[/b]!
[b]Be brave[/b]!
[b]Be powerful[/b]!
