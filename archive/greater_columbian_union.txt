Formed in 1955 after the conclusion of the tension between the Northern Union of Columbia and the Southern Union of Columbia, the Greater Columbian Union is the international face of Continental Columbia. It is a Confederate Union with a broad initiative for pushing for re-unification, with all member states militaries working together loosely and economic ties making each member reliant on the other, cementing the bond. In 1965 the continental nations reunified under the First Union of Columbia, bringing about a new age of peace, but keeping the GCU as a safeguard to its allies and sphere of influence.
