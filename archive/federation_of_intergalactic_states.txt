The Federation of Intergalactic States (FIS) is a alliance between peacekeeping and democratic nations in NationStates. We are dedicated to preserving peace in the world of NationStates, and strive to be the best region we can. If you love role-playing, FIS is the perfect region for you! Here in the FIS, we do a lot of role-playing. If you do decide to join, please try to be active as much as possible (It is understood if you cannot get on often, but please say so in the regional chat if you will not be able to get on.) 
Welcome to the Federation of Intergalactic States!
