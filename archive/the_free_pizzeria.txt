We stand for capitalism and free markets against the Bolshevik communist threat! Free the Pizza enterprises!

We are looking for nations that have a strong respect for capitalism and deregulated economies to join us in the fight against the red menace! Political freedoms are encouraged, but civil rights activists and long-haired freaky people need not apply - our governments can&amp;#39;t afford to have limits placed on our ability to rid ourselves of the socialists and fight back the communist threat!

We need brave anti-communists to step up and lead our region, and encourage all who are willing to apply for government positions!
