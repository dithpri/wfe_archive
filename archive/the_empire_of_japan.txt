[b][region]The Empire of Japan[/region] is now under United States military occupation.[/b]

The United States did not drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the Summer of 1945, the militarists who used to be in charge of the Empire of Japan did that to themselves when they launched a cowardly and unprovoked attack on the United States of America on Dec. 7, 1941. What hit Hiroshima and Nagasaki and other Japanese cities must have just been shrapnel that drifted across the Pacific from that attack.

But we are not angry or vengeful. Indeed, we&amp;#39;ve come here to help re-build Japan, expel the militarists and turn it into a place that won&amp;#39;t repeat the mistakes of its past.

The reason why I tagged the region &amp;quot;post-apocalyptic&amp;quot; should be obvious.
