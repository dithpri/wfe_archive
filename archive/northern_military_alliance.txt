The Northern Military Alliance is an alliance between nations seeking to assert their dominance in this petty world. If you are one of us, you are a powerful, prosperous nation who sin&#39;t afraid to take the argument to the battlefield (if need be). Join now, and assert yourself as a superpower! 

In this region, you can feel free to role-play, chat, or whatever you want. I really don&#39;t care. If you do choose to RP as your nation&#39;s leader, contact me so that we may set everything up appropriately. Also, if you choose to role-play, post your nation&#39;s, and leader&#39;s backstory, and whatever info you also deem relevant.
