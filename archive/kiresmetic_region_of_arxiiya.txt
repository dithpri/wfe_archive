We are an accepting region, accepting all types of countries. We are based on the ideology of Kiresme, which is the ideology that we are all together, no matter what type of country you are. We accept all, and always will. Arxiiya will forever stay like this.
Aid will be inevitable. Just join, and expand Arxiiya, and the ideology of Kiresme, to the WA, and other regions.

Tip: It is more likely you will be respected if you join the WA.


From your new Leader,
Leader of Ericsia
