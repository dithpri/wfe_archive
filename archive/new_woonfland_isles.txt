We are the revamped version of the old Woonfland Isles, still located all around southeastern Oceania, we have many peaceful policies and great environments, however, some of our nations have not flourished in environments like the rest of us.

We do not go to war, and we don&#39;t really have any strict limiting policies, overall, living in the New Woonfland Isles is having a pretty free life regarding any citizens of the matter.

However, the rules that do exist are:
- No Racism or Discrimination
- No Forum/Discord Spamming
- No WA cheating with alts
- No (non-revolutionary) war

If you follow these rules, we will have no issues in accepting you!

I hope you enjoy the region, and partake in many activities involving it.
