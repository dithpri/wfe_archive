It&#39;s the remix to &quot;Ignition&quot;
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin&#39; that body got every man in here wishin&#39; (Wishin&#39; now)
Sippin&#39; on Coke and rum (Rum)
I&#39;m like, &quot;So what? I&#39;m drunk&quot; (Drunk)
It&#39;s the freakin&#39; weekend, baby, I&#39;m about to have me some fun (Fun)
