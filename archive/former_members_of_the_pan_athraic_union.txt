After the collapse of the Pan-Athraic Union(aka P.A.U) in December 3rd. 2022, it&#39;s state-members were left abandoned to fend for themselves. This resulted in many conflicts, such as the Konitsa Massacre of 2022, the Annexation of the former Capital from Athraic Extremists, and the Pan-Athraic civil war, that lasted from January 10st 2023 to January 20th. 

In an attempt to stop the conflicts, the Federal Republic of Epirotic States decided that it would stray way from its neighbours and follow their own path, along with anyone who was willing to join.

And that&#39;s why the FMPAU was founded, so that the people who experienced the atrocities of the collapse can work together to a better future for them and their nations.
