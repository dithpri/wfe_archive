Is a small, tight-knit community. Our founder [nation]The Order of The Tsar[/nation] founded this region with the intent of fighting the wretches of capitalism. Within this region, we will always support one another in the quest to become a world power, to spread communism and free the world of inequality, for everyone. 

[color=red]OUR GOAL[/color] 
Is to become an influential part of the world assembly. The Nations of this Region are working among themselves to work out the governmental systems and how to organize our own structure. This Region is rather young, but it is strong and confident. We aim to become what our potential allows.
