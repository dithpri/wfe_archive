Welcome to the IPNE, your little slice of the apocalypse!
Any and all political leanings are accepted as long as you&#39;re out to have fun, and if you&#39;re looking for some RP send a telegraph to some of your neighbors!

[u]Some RP rules:[/u]
- Any kind of technology is allowed as long as it isn&#39;t space travel past our solar system or making your nation godlike and overpowered.
- Mutants have not been confirmed or denied as region canon, self aware AI does exist.
- No magic, fantasy creatures, or classic fantasy races.

Check the dispatches below for some regional lore and history.

[b]We all hope you enjoy your stay.[/b]
