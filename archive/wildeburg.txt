Wildeburg is a region of equal human rights and a happy economy. All nations that are a part of this region will not be asked to bow down to the feet of the leader and/or founder like many dictatorships, but merely pay respect to the founder and/or leader. Our economy will evolve with the growing amount of politically right nations in this region. Not only will people have fair and just rights, but also the nation itself within the region.
