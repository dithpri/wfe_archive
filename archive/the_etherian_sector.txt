The Aether Collective created the Etherian Sector, a vast region of interconnected sky-cities and orbital habitats suspended above the planet&#146;s surface. United under a technocratic government known as the Aether Collective, the Collective values innovation, unity, and the pursuit of transcendence through technology. Its citizens&#151;known as Etherians&#151;live within gleaming towers and luminous bridges powered by the planet&#146;s boundless energy currents. From its capital, Radiant Prime, the Aether Collective oversees both the skies and the lands below, guiding civilization toward a future where thought and matter become one.
