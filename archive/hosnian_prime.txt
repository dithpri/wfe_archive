[color=blue]A planet in the Hosnian system of the Core Worlds, located along the Corellian Trade Spine. Thirty years after the Battle of Endor, it served as the headquarters of the Galactic Senate and capital of the New Republic during the conflict between the Resistance and the First Order.

In 34 ABY, seeking to rid the galaxy of what it saw as the illegitimate Republic government, the First Order used its superweapon, Starkiller Base, to destroy Hosnian Prime and all other planetary bodies in the system. The superweapon caused the ignition of Hosnian Prime&#39;s core, transforming the planet into a star in a pocket nova.[/color]
