[hr][color=#334AD7][i]Some time had passed. Zero Beta was doing well. Ever since the demise of Zero, the nations that stayed loyal to it were all that remained; but they were soon joined by many nations of all kinds. This new universe was a mere glimmer of what once was, but it was their new home. And they would build it to new heights. A new story. Now, all they needed to do was watch from afar.

Greetings from Zero Beta, nations of the world.[/i][/color]
