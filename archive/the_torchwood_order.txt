The Torchwood Order is a small fledgling region where each member has sovereignty over their own peoples, while maintaining military and economic alliances among themselves. We are currently seeking new members to join the Order. A few benefits of joining the Order is that, due to the incredibly small size, you will have great regional influence, and a greater chance to rise to positions of power. However, we do ask that all member nations remain active in recruiting other nations to join the Order. As a protective measure, the Torchwood Order is a password-protected region. Contact the founder nation,The Principality of Rayleaa for membership information.
