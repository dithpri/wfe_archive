The Torchwood Order began as an offshoot of the Pacific and those dissatisfied with the New Pacific Order. With a highly regulated membership, nations must go through a strict application process to become a member. The Order values the sovereignty of each country within their own boarders. However, a core of common goals and values allows for the Order to pass guidelines for each member to follow. The Order has a unique league system, allowing members to work together within the Order and to more efficiently pass legislation.
