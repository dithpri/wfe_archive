In memory of all those who have left us.

&amp;quot;What the heart has once owned and had, it will never lose.&amp;quot; - Henry Ward Beecher

&amp;quot;As long as we live, they too will live; for they are now are a part of us; as we remember them.&amp;quot; - Sylvan Kamens and Rabbi Jack Riemer

&amp;quot;They carried all they could bear, and then some, including a silent awe for the terrible power of the things they carried.&amp;quot; - Tim O&amp;#39;Brien
