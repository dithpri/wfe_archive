The Guardian Coast is free for all to enter.  This a new region, we are not trying to become a political power of any sort, we are just a group of people who want to grow our nations without much drama.  If you join, you won&#39;t be harassed with regular telegrams, and there probably won&#39;t be much going on in our message board.  This is a region for people who want to see how the game plays out, without having to constantly reply to posts and messages.
