West Turhal is a peninsula jutting out from a greater, unknown continent which lies to its east. It is a large peninsula, featuring diverse and breathtaking geography due to the often violent plate tectonics of the region. Traditionally it is a land in which settlers from other places would arrive, as the fertile soil and originally low population made for great opportunities. Recently, however, West Turhal has been involved in international wars which put a strain on their economies and inherently tie them to the destiny of the larger world. Originally a haven, West Turhal features some of the most varied governments and cultures, often a mix of the native population and foreign influences.
