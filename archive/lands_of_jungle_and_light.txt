[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to host an interregional quiz bowl! While it turns out hawks are very good at flying to and from the event, Assassins are better at trivia, we always knew they were hiding some knowledge under those cloaks.

Don&#39;t worry, some internet Janitors will be along soon enough to clean up our mess!
