This region is for all people who are ending their time on NS. Fiji you are welcome when you pass on the delegacy, GNP when you&amp;#39;re ready, and anyone else from the INWU (or elsewhere) who feels the need to move on.

I specifically dedicate this to [nation=short]El_Fiji_Grande[/nation], [nation=short]Estradia[/nation], [nation=short]Onza[/nation],  [nation=short]Greater_New_Poland[/nation], [nation=short]Topsail_Empire[/nation], [nation=short]Ichoria[/nation], [nation=short]Mallaska[/nation], and [nation=short]Atlantica[/nation] for being the most interesting and fun people on this site that I&amp;#39;ve become friends with.

Unfortunately, life gets in the way sometimes, and added pressures of adulthood means scaling back time on video games.

Good luck to you all, and I wish you the best.

Good bye!
