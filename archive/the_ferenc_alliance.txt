Monday, July 4th, 2016: The Free Land of Yascad discovered a small group of newly developed nations and bound them together. The key tenets of this alliance are the following:

Through friendship we find unity.
Through unity we find strength.
Through strength we have a voice.
With our voice may we be set free!

Entering the Ferenc Alliance requires agreement to the Jarek Concordat, and upon doing so the nation will be issued the regions passcode, and thereby given permission to enter the region.
