A recently formed region, Hobokin was created by the Sacred Empire of Avrida and The Rogue Nation of Everfree. They came together to create a region for those &amp;quot;hobo nations&amp;quot; that feel neglected by their previous regions. Here they can live in peace as equals despite their beliefs and/or preferences.
