Before there was Zimbabwe there was Rhodesia, the breadbasket and jewel of Africa where Western Civilization and Christianity prevailed in the face of sanctions and terrorist activity; this space is dedicated to the memory of what came before and those who lived through it. 

Racism and Fascism have no place here!!!!

Happy 60th Independence Day, Rhodesia :)
