Welcome to the region! Now for story. Dedicated to preserving the Sikh way of life, this region was founded recently as a safe haven. With common elections and a benevolent founder to protect against invasion, the region is full of democracy and equality. Relatively new, the elections may be unopposed, so get in there, and enjoy the Global Sikh Federation!

We will be holding elections for certain positions, and some will be appointed, based on skill in the region.
