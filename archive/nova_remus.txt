[color=red]Welcome to Nova Remus![/color]
Like our ancestor Rome, we are named for a founder of Rome. One called Romulus founded the great empire we study today, the other Remus, who was never payed tribute. This land is named for him to honor the ways of old and embrace new ways of thinking. We will become the strongest of nations, joined together with post-modern technology and the greatest of leaders! We will combined our forces under our great emperor, as a senate of nations, to rise above the rest!
