Founded in 1919, After the World War I ended, G&euml;rmania decided to create an Alliance to prevent future wars and rebellions.

During the Great Depression, G&euml;rmania was in the worst-case of economic failure and amidst of man named, Adolph Gitler, he has believed G&euml;rmania&#39;s savior, and after a year, he created also known as the National Socialist&#39;s Workers Party.

His party won in 1928 and has taken over the minds of the G&euml;rmania.

His plan was to re-arm the G&euml;rmanian Army and to take revenge to the Allied Forces.

But as the United Germanian Alliance was created, we prevented it by brainwashing that the Allied was sending donation to G&euml;rmania and helping G&euml;rmania from The Great Depression and has stopped the WW2 to occur.
