We are an alliance that commits to free trade, capitalism, and the protection of personal, political, and economic freedom. To remain a member, you must maintain civil rights as a #1 priority, and we have to look at results, not intention (Socialism for example,sounds moral by putting everyone on the same playing field, but is unfair considering how everyone is different and nobody is truly equal, thus getting different results and requiring more theft to balance the income. This will not be tolerated). You must maintain excellent civil and political rights and freedom with results and good intention.
