[color=Brown]Out where the handclasp&#39;s a little stronger,
Out where the smile dwells a little longer,
That&#39;s where the West begins;

Out where the sun is a little brighter,
Where the snows that fall are a trifle whiter,
Where the bonds of home are a wee bit tighter,
That&#39;s where the West begins.[/color]
