The Eurasian Holy Union was co-founded by the Jingoistic States of Kampong Glam and the Constitutional Monarchy of Geonosis Prime. The Eurasian Holy Union spans across Europe and Asia uniting the two continents under one God&#151; the Christian God. The main religions in the Eurasian Holy Alliance are Roman Catholicism and Orthodoxy. There are denominational minorities, but these minorities are often quiet and ample. The Eurasian Holy Alliance is often referred to as the second Holy Roman Empire. To join this alliance, your nation has to value spirituality highly, and has to be based in Europe, Asia, and Oceania.
