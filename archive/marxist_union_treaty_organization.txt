 [I][color=darkorange]&quot;Our cause is virtuous and just; we wage this war in the name of basic human decency! We are allied as comrades regardless of our race, class, education...we are one! And so too shall we be one as we stand in solidarity for the oppressed, the exploited. The fight will continue...&quot;[/color][/I]
