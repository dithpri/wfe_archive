Seven Stars is an forgotten and isolated temperate archipelago of seven islands, the largest of which is centrally located. It was home to the ancient Empire of Seven Stars before its mysterious collapse. Its nations are technological oddities, relying on whale oil due to the combination of unnavigable waters surrounding the islands, zero fossil fuel deposits, and an super-abundance of whales in the archipelago.
