The Fathers&#39; Dominion spans vast and diverse landscapes, ranging from fertile plains and majestic mountains to dense forests and coastal regions. It is bordered by neighboring nations on all sides, which has influenced its historical and cultural interactions over the centuries.
The Fathers&#39; Dominion follows a paternalistic form of governance, where fathers are regarded as the primary authority figures within each family unit and extend their influence to the nation as a whole. The empire is an absolute monarchy, with the Supreme Father serving as the paramount ruler.
