[b][i]Welcome to [region]Splitwood Bog[/region], heroes![/b][/i]

This foggy marshland, named after the giant logs used to bridge its largest pools, will test your sanity. Be wary as you trudge along, though, for [nation=short]Zosha the Whirlwind[/nation] lurks somewhere in the mist. One of the Rat Clan&#39;s most cunning assassins, Zosha&#39;s most burning desire is to slay the corrupted [nation=short]King of Armello[/nation].

However, the King&#39;s spies are many and everywhere; his Agents of Misfortune search every inch of the swamp for her day and night, with Zosha barely managing to stay one step ahead. Whichever Clan scores the most points will slay the evil agents, save Zosha and claim the Bog! Good luck to you all!
