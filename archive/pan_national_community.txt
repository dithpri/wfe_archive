[b]The [color=red]Pan National Community[/color][/b]

This is a democratic, non-exclusionary region designed to be open to all forms of nation, no matter the size or political beliefs.

On our external forums we will form governments and pass laws according to the will off the people.

Also, we do have one requirement, nations must have a sense of humour (and at least a grasp of sarcasm) to qualify :D
