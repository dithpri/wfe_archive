[b]Established in 2025[/b],the Civic Coalition is an alliance of centrist, conservative, and populist forces committed to national stability, sovereignty, and civic order. Rooted in national conservatism, social conservatism, social patriotism, and right-wing populism, it incorporates economic liberalism and traditional values to restore balance between citizen and state, defend families and regional communities, and protect the regions against the rise of left-wing extremism and far-left communist movements.
