The Pravene Isles are a group of islands home to the Federated Commonwealth of Pravengria. The islands remained much on the map during the colonial ages, when the Pravene Empire stretched across numerous regions. After the 2nd Geannese Separatist War in 1970-1976, the FCP now has just a few smaller over-seas territories which it retains mostly for political and military reasons.
