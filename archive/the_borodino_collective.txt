The Borodino Collective is home to a small but select group of obscure nations with a propensity for bizarrity and the vaguely unhinged. Founded on a continent made mainly of discarded beverage containers from more consumerist regions our economies may be weak but our people are... ummm... also fairly weak, though with a whistful melancholy that gives our arts and drama a certain lightness that stirs the soul and enraptures the mind. That and we make bloody good borscht.
