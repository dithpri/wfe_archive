This is meant for my non-significant farming nations, hence their names. I know this isn&#146;t anything special or anything, I insist on my main account being a secret. It&#146;s pretty easy to figure out who it is though. 

Telegram [nation]Federated state of Vichlein[/nation] (which is another alt) for inquiries or other things. I also want a regional banner for this region, so telegram the same alt if you have any suggestions.

I don&#146;t need cards at the moment, so I&#146;ll maintain this region but not really use it. Also the free card offer is still available.

Also multiple of my alts have mentioned my main account, so that&#146;s another clue.

Telegram [nation]Federated state of Vichlein[/nation] to get a chance to earn a card from [nation]Minor farmer 8[/nation]! :D
