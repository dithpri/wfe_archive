Deep my dreaming, fresh my waking
Furled in fragrant leaf and mold,
When the brumal mists are quaking
In the crimson-kindling cold.
In the scraggy copse I smolder,
Swarthy brush and red-tipped thorn,
In the dank-edged leaves I molder,
Switch the shock and light the corn.
On the yellow-rippling river,
By the wood-pool&#39;s reeded edge,
Fleet my dappling shadows quiver
Over auburn brake and sedge.
