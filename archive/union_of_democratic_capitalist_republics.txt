[b]WELCOME TO THE UDCR![/b]
[hr]Co-founded by [nation=short]Korporations[/nation] and [nation=short]Fascist Prussian Empire[/nation], we are a libertarian region.
[hr]In order to join, your nation must be one of the following WA categories:
[i]Inoffensive Centrist Democracy | New York Times Democracy | Capitalist Paradise | Corporate Bordello | Left-Leaning College State | Civil Rights Lovefest | Capitalizt | Anarchy[/i]

These restrictions are purely for the promotion of libertarianism within our region. For example, [i]Democratic Socialists[/i] is not admitted because it promotes suppression of economic freedoms.
