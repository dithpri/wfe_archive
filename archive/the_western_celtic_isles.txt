The Western Celtic Isles are a geographical region, defined by a summation of islands, scattered off the coast of the celtic mainland. Generally, these islands were rather undesirable due to their low fertility and mostly humid weather. Through this, however, the nations that inhabbited them managed to attain a certain degree of identity, despite the numerous attempts of foreign invasion.

The nations, inhabitting this region, aim to strive for green, ecological and sustainable high-technological developement. The Foreign Office aims for fair relations with all well-intentioned regions and is willing to act as a diplomatic mediator.
