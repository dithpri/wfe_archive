The Western Celtic Isles are a geographic region defined by a summation of islands, scattered off the coast of the Celtic mainland. Generally, these islands were rather undesirable due to their low fertility and mostly humid weather. Through this, however, the nations that inhabited them managed to attain a certain degree of identity, despite the numerous attempts at foreign invasion.
