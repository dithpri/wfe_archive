The Western Celtic Isles are a geographical region, defined by a summation of islands, scattered off the coast of the celtic mainland. Generally, these islands were rather undesirable due to their low fertility and generally humid weather. Through this, however, the nations that inhabbited them managed to attain a certain degree of identity, despite the numerous attempts of foreign invasion.
