This Republic is open to all. This republican democracy region elects it&#39;s officers every two months, where there will be four elections, one for WA delegate, and another for the Leader of the People, another for Minister of Foreign Policy, and lastly Head Of Communications. We welcome you to join, and hopefully we will become the greatest region. However, if you become a nuisance and a problem to the region, you shall be expelled from the region, decided by a special meeting of the officers. If you have any questions, please ask on the board. The government of this region is still being set up until a Constitutional Convention has been secretly held by the officers.
