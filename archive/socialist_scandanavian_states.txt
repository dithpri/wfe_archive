A personal region for people I know, we are mostly socialist/communist Scandinavian nations. The regional currency is the Krone (created by The Treaty of Stockholm), and upon joining should be changed to that, though it appears Wankea hasn&amp;#39;t.
The majority of the nations in the SSS are socialist, and have moderate to low economic freedoms, with moderate to high civil rights, but variable political freedom.
