So this is basically a fallout rp region, the idea is that nations in this region are factions currently running the new great plains (states north of texas and south of north Dakota). The larger and more influence your nation has in the region, the larger the faction you are. The two executive nations are the largest and most prominent factions (the NCR and legion for Fallout New Vegas for example)
