The Milky Way Systems Confederation is the largest interstellar cooperative organization ever created. It brings together thousands of civilizations, stellar empires, planetary republics, cosmic monarchies, synthetic collectives, and non-corporeal species that inhabit the vast spiral arms of the galaxy.

Founded after the era known as the Great Interplanetary Collapse, the Assembly represents an unprecedented effort to maintain peace, diplomacy, and harmonious development among all conscious worlds.

Each member nation retains its sovereignty but participates in building a stable galactic order based on cooperation, mutual respect, and the prevention of conflict on a cosmic scale.
