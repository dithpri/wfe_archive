[i][b][color=Green]Hey guys, [nation]Frenchy II[/nation] here from [region]The Ragerian Imperium[/region]! Back before I was a raider, I was a native to this region, then we all migrated to [region]Asylum[/region], where I was a native and a delegate for 260-some days. Basically I want this region to now serve as A. A memorial for what it once was B. I just want the region and C. To look like I actually did something as a raider? Anyway come join [region]The Ragerian Imperium[/region] military and stuff. Catch y&#39;all later.
