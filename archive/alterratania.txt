Alterratania. 
Current state of regional administration:
Region currently needs to agree on the manner in which the region&#39;s Committee of Governance of Alterratania will be elected, including how the position of President shall be given and how subordinate roles shall be given. Currently, since there is no agreed manner in which these roles are to be given, the regional Founder shall assume all administrative roles until further notice. 
The power of the World Assembly Delegate shall also be null until an agreement is made as to how that role will function beyond its representative role to the WA.
