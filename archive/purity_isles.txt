Once, this was a proud region. Battles were waged here; friends betrayed each other and became loyal once more. The original Purity Isles was enemies with [region]Mirare[/region]. Now those that came before are naught but a memory, and Mirare has taken back this land that used to be its mortal foe.

In the end, Mirare always wins.
[hr]Purity Isles is a protectorate of [region]Mirare[/region]. Please be aware of the following guidelines:
1. ALL embassy requests will be rejected. NO exceptions.
2. Nations are asked not to dwell here unless given permission by Mirare&amp;#39;s Delegate
3. Nations are asked to refrain from posting on the RMB to symbolize the silencing of the original members by their inactivity. Let this region sink into obscurity, never to grace the World Happenings again.
