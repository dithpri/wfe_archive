Try to be best
Cause you&amp;#39;re only a man
And a man&amp;#39;s gotta learn to take it
Try to believe
Though the going gets rough
That you gotta hang tough to make it
History repeats itself
Try and you&amp;#39;ll succeed
Never doubt that you&amp;#39;re the one
And you can have your dreams!

You&amp;#39;re the best!
Around!
Nothing&amp;#39;s gonna ever keep you down
You&amp;#39;re the Best!
Around!
Nothing&amp;#39;s gonna ever keep you down
You&amp;#39;re the Best!
Around!
Nothing&amp;#39;s gonna ever keep you dow-ow-ow-ow-own
