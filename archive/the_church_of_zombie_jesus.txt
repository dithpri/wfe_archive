Hey Metalheads! The Metal Gods of the [color=blue]NORTH PACIFIC ARMY[/color] have come to put on a concert in your region! \m/  (o_o)  \m/

Heres our first song!
This is your time to pay,
This is your judgment day,
We made a sacrifice,
And now we get to take your region.

We shoot without a gun,
We&#39;ll take on anyone,
It&#39;s really nothing new,
It&#39;s just a thing we like to do.
