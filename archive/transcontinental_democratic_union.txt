The Transcontinental Democratic Union (aka TCDU) is a group of strictly democratic states dedicated to upholding democracy across the world. Any states that join and lack a democratic system of government will be promptly exiled. The region is in favor of all political leanings and will hold polls to determine the vote of the delegate in upcoming assembly votes. If the delegate fails to follow the wishes of the member states they will be promptly impeached. Any state to join the TCDU can count on the delegate to vote in the best interests of democracy in nations that are members of the region or not. If you wish for your voice to be heard in the World Assembly the TCDU is your best option.
