[b][i]&quot;The greatest purveyor of violence in the world today is my own government&quot;.[/i] 
-- Martin Luther King Jr., April 4, 1967. 

And it&#39;s all been downhill since.[/b]

[b][i][color=royalblue]Hey, baby, take a walk on the wild side of our Sclerotic Spiritual Paralysis and 
step into the Collateral Kill-Zone of our Target-Rich Environment for we are the[/color] 
[color=red]Weaponized Celestial Behemoth of Multigenerational Murder[/color][color=royalblue] 
where every Prayer is a Liturgy of Lies.[/i][/b][/color]

[b][i]Dear Lord we give thanks for our bountiful harvest of beautiful bombs 
for it is with bombs that America expresses its explosive love for the world 
American bombs are publicly subsidized sacraments 
each one ripe with the shrapnel of salvation. 
Amen[/i][/b]
