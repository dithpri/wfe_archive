Hey welcome to The [color=green]Atypical[/color] [color=grey]Imperial[/color] [color=orange]Nations[/color]!
[hr]
The Atypical Imperial Nations are a group of nations who have agreed to recognize the Atypical Empress&#39;s sovereignty over their lands. They can do mostly anything they want but they must come Imperial debates occasionally. Other than that they can do anything that doesn&#39;t hurt or get in the way of the empire.
