[b]Greetings![/b]

[color=#27b59d]Plans, ideas, and visions which have been floating about deep in the underground are ready to be realised. The turquoise eruption is beginning, spirits are awakening. The lush swathes are ready to bloom. The most nonpareil region to have ever existed is about to arrive.[/color]

[b]Update 2:[/b] I&#39;d been working on this region for months upon months. I&#39;ve made the most intricate and amazing map NS has ever seen. However, after years of inactivity, my group of NS friends have moved on. I&#39;ve also lost motivation and interest. Nowadays I&#39;m more into mapping than RPing. For now, I have set up a region for OGF mappers - [region]OGF RolePlay[/region]
