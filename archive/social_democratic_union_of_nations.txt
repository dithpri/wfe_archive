[color=red]Welcome to the Social Democratic Union of Nations![/color] This is one of many of my attempts at creating a new region, but I think I can pull this off. I created [nation]Nammel[/nation] as a puppet founder for the region so I can be apart of the democratic process of the region. However, as you can see, there is not enough members to create a democracy. So I&#39;ll serve as a Provisional Dictator until the region increases it&#39;s population. Please send me a telegram if you want to help out. I&#39;ll make you an officer. When we get enough people, we&#39;ll create a democratic government with a constitution and everything. As of now the only requirement of joining is being a democratic socialist.
