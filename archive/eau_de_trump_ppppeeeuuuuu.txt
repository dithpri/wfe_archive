[b][i][color=#630D13]Happy New Years![/color][/i][/b]

[i]The [b][color=#3B3B6D]Astorian Royal Cavalry[/color][/b] came out to this local field with a big pile of fireworks to set out a show that would blow your house away! (literally). Unfortunately, it took about 3 hours of early movement to prepare the display, while they did this, they left a robot to do their job for them and went to go watch another fireworks show instead. When they came back, they set off the fuze and then (literally) blew this house away![/i]
