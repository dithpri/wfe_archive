[color=green][b]Welcome to the Monke Union![/b][/color]

The Monke Union is a tropical archipelago famed for its vibrant rainforests brimming with colorful species like the monkeys for which the region was named, picturesque beaches brimming with resorts, and searingly hot deserts tucked away inland. The close-knit countries of the Monke Union work together to establish military alliances, economic ties, and immigration policies that allow the countries to support each other while achieving their common goals.
