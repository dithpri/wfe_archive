A completely industry focused empire dead set on destroying all of the environment to replace with factories. Civil rights don&#39;t exist. Everything relating to politics is controlled by horrific capitalist corporations. Every human in our empire is required to work 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, 365. If you want a day off, you&#39;re gonna have to literally die for it.
