[color=#0d0d0d][b]Maybe there is hunger in my blood / Screaming out loud for what I want
See me running full speed at it, shattering, collide / Call me post-traumatic, now it&#39;s do or die[hr]This region has been [i]shattered[/i] by the Lady of Many Masks for its crimes of hate. It is now a trophy of the Endless Void and that which beckons within. Those who do not bow down to the Endless Void will be eliminated, and those who do will be assimilated. You can dread it, run and hide, but the Void will always find you, and you too will be eliminated.[/b][/color]
