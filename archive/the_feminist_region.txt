[b]The [u][i]Feminist[/i][/u] Region[/b] is now under the protection of the NationStates world&amp;#39;s foremost feminist organization, [b]the [region]Femdom Empire[/region][/b] and Her allies. 

Unlike organizations that call themselves &amp;quot;defenders&amp;quot; but actually specialize in leaving regions defense[u][i]less[/i][/u], [b]the [region]Femdom Empire[/region][/b] will remain here as long as is necessary to make this sister gynocentric region of ours safe from misogynistic attack.

[b]The region is now locked and closed.[/b]
But if you would like to help the cause, there are other ways you can do so.
Please contact [b][nation]Femina Commanda[/nation][/b] for more details.

Praise Sisterhood, and Femmepower!

[b]The [region]Femdom Empire[/region][/b]
