Feminism is the belief in gender equality.
Let me start of by saying that gender is not synonymous with sex.
Sex = The biological differences between a man and a woman.
Gender = The characteristics and behaviour associated with man and woman, originating with cultures stemming from organised religion.

This region is not a difference feminist region, but believes that human nature, at its core, is androgynous. We do not believe that having a penis or a vagina dictates your personality and behaviour. It&amp;#39;s nonsensical.

We are genderqueer, and we are proud!

I also hope that &amp;#39;Feminism&amp;#39; will soon become a tag on the regions list, and I am quite offended that it isn&amp;#39;t.
