[b]Welcome to The Feminist Region![/b]

&amp;quot;Originally founded June 12, 2012 by [nation]Adrogyna[/nation], who ceased to exist six months later. After getting tossed around for another six months by various misogynistic invader groups, the Femdom Empire and Her allies finally liberated it from June 10 to July 19, 2013, refounding it on the morning of August 7.&amp;quot; - Femdom Empire (the nation)

That this was a true liberation (as opposed to a forced refound, against native wishes) is contested. Femdom Empire herself ceased to exist on September 8, 2014, leaving The Feminist Region vulnerable again. A coalition of raider armies occupied the region for 37 days, and the region was liberated on October 19, 2014.

&amp;quot;Feminism is the belief in gender equality.&amp;quot; - from Adrogyna&amp;#39;s WFE
