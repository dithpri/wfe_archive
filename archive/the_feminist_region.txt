[b]The [u][i]Feminist[/i][/u] Region[/b] is now under the protection of the NationStates world&amp;#39;s foremost feminist organization, [b]the [region]Femdom Empire[/region][/b] and Her allies. 

Unlike organizations that call themselves &amp;quot;defenders&amp;quot; but actually specialize in leaving regions defense[u][i]less[/i][/u], [b]the [region]Femdom Empire[/region][/b] will remain here as long as is necessary to make this sister gynocentric region of ours safe from misogynistic attack.

To expedite that process, [u][b]all non-WA members must now leave[/b][/u].

[b]Membership is by invitation only.[/b]
If you would like to be invited, contact [b][nation]Femina Commanda[/nation][/b].

Praise Sisterhood, and Femmepower!

[b]The [region]Femdom Empire[/region][/b]
