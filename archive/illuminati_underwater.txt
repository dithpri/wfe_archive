Someday, [color=blue]Atlantis[/color] will return from the depths, and the wisdom of the ancients will be rediscovered. Eventually, the citadel of [color=green]R&amp;#39;lyeh[/color] will rise again, and Great Cthulhu will destroy mankind in his wrath and madness.

And, one day, the true [color=purple]Illuminati[/color] will reappear and reclaim their secret hegemony over the world from the imposters and charlatans currently using that name, and a new [color=orange]Golden Age[/color] will commence.

Do you believe that? Well, why not? I thought it was a really good story myself.
