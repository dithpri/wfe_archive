[b]Welcome to the &quot;[i]World Folk Congregation[/i]&quot;![/b]

This region aims to aggregate NationStates players who carry the banner of ancestral spirituality, a spirituality that promotes ties with its own people and with Nature.

In case of doubt about what is really intended here, Paganism, Polytheism, Ethnic/ Autochthonous Religion, Animism (among many other definitions and aspects) are welcome.

[b]For our People, for the Nature, for our Faith.[/b]
