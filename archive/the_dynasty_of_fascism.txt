Hello my good people! I am your Founder and friend and I would like to welcome you to The Dynasty of Fascism! Sure, you probably aren&#146;t fascist, but who cares? Just join us and you&#146;ll be happy! We talk about

&#149; Anime &amp;#128522; 
&#149; Good things &amp;#128077;&amp;#127995; 
&#149; FASCISM (Jk) &amp;#128526; 

And much more! Also, run for World Alliance (WA) Delegate. There are many perks of being a WA Delegate, such as getting authority over Executive, Appearance, Embassies, Communications, Polls, etc (if there&#146;s more). This is a small region, but with just the right amount of people, we can be a Dynasty! Join us and we will be powerful! Heheheheh.....
