     We are conservatives looking for nations like us.  We are looking for people who know what they are doing and know to run things.

     Everyone is equal and will have a say in our decisions.  We beleive in what is right for our people.

     We will have elections and hopefully soon, a forum.  Everyone is equally taxed.

     Our motto is, &amp;quot;Ultra humanus&amp;quot; which is latin for, &amp;quot;Beyond human&amp;quot;.

     We look forward to having you if you are willing to join us!  You may always leave if you do not like it!
