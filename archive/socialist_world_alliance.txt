&amp;#127757; Welcome to the Socialist World Alliance! We are a region that believes strongly in the ideas of socialism and democracy as hinted in our name. 

&amp;#127759; We welcome any nation that wishes to join in the hope of inspiring socialism, pacifism as well as many other left wing and centrist strategies. Nations of all sizes and influence are free to take part in our Regional Elections, and give candidacy for any position that is up for election. This region also wishes to be less bureaucratic and serious that the many regions that dominate NationStates play to. Here we are all about fun. 

&amp;#127758; Finally Remember, what is beneficial for the people, is beneficial for the world!
