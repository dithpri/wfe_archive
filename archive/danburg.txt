[b][color=orange] IT&#146;S SPOOKY SEASON! (almost) the sekhmet legion along with their friends decided to go out and celebrate. 

They partook in many halloween themed activities, such as costume contests (unfortunately some of our friends from BoM got disqualified from this, as it turns out already being a vampire is considered cheating), listening to spooky music, and watching horror movies!

It was a great time, so great in fact that it brought us right to your front door, please don&#39;t mind us, we just thought it would be a great spot to set up a party![/color]

If you too would like to partake in the spooky, [url=https://osiris.valthost.com/index.php] why don&#146;t you pop in and say hello?[/url][/b]
