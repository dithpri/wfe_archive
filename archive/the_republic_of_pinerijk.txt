Pinerijk, or commonly known as Duumland among its citizens, is a thriving continent full of queer nations. It is situated near the Arctic Circle in the Pacific Ocean. It is relatively large and has a freezing climate, except for the cloud forest that can be found in one of the nations.

The culture varies between each country, some being more extreme for other. Such as in Nutcaseland where cannibalism is legal but in Freakoland it is considered morally wrong. Political views are also very extreme. Whereas in Orangeinton slavery is legal but in Eracite it is punishable by death.

All-in-all, it is a very strange continent with very different cultures.
