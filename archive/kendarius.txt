[b]HISTORY[/b]

Kendarius, the artificially-constructed supercontinent, was once was composed of many smaller rogue-like nations. Over time, these smaller nations conglomerated into 2 prominent superpowers: Demterra and [nation]Revivimus[/nation]. Demterra, at the time, was a more decentralized democratic country that delegated more power to individual states rather than a central government with extensive enumerated powers. Revivimus on the other hand, ran by a group of oligarchs who had no desire to give up their power, opted into a communist state-planned economy, which in addition to the few civil and political liberties citizens had, strengthened the iron-grip these oligarchs had over the nation. In the current day, Kenderius is home to 5 total new nations.
