[b][u]WELCOME TO TEST001[/u][/b]

Here, we strive for testing and conceptualizing a form of regional government to implement in the future. 

No member nations may join the WA, but all will get a government position.

Also, we dislike the idea of an RMB.

All member nations must be [i]Lukljaef [letter][/i], or face ejection.

Yes, we know that we&#39;re weird. We don&#39;t care.
