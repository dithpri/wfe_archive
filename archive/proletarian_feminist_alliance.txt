For too long working woman have been oppressed by the bourgeois and the patriarchy that dominates society. We seek to put an end to this oppression, and have it so that all genders are equal, no matter gender identity or social class. Everyone shall have equal opportunity, and discrimination based on race, gender identity, social class, or sexuality shall be outlawed. All nations within this region agree to have affirmative action plans to eliminate the differences between people until equality is achieved. There will be no his/her in the nation, only comrades.
