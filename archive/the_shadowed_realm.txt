This is the official declaration of the death of this region.
A couple of the major events of the region:
    105 days ago: Embassy established between CRNA RUKA and The Shadowed realm.
    351 days ago: Embassy established between The alliance of homework and The Shadowed realm.
    1 year 195 days ago: Region founded by The United peoples of Nation of cool guys.
Special thanks to:
[nation]the war of 85[/nation], for being a active resident
[nation]cousta luna da albera[/nation] for being a active resident
Thank you all for your effort to keep this region alive.
There&amp;#39;s not much left to give anyone, so there won&amp;#39;t be a will to anybody.
The region will be open for those who want to pass through.
Perhaps this will be an active region again.
