The shadowed realm
Home of the Dark Raiders
We defend the poor, and wreck those we deem too powerful
Those who mess with us are never seen again

The black sun has supplies us with firearms via black market
The Empire of the Sith supply us with soldiers
the GDC form our military backbone 
Together, we are unstoppable
