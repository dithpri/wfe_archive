Welcome to [i]The Shadowed Realm!!![/i]  We are a peacekeeper force operating outside the WA, which stupidly is not allowed to
front a peacekeeper force of any kind, therefore not being able to enforce rules.

Well, We are here to start enforcing peace.

And the Black Riders are kinda in the way of this goal.


So join up! No password, WA delegate elections are every other week.

Not Allowed:
No goofing off, or racism, swearing, abusing people, abusing delegate powers, ect.

Allowed:
Secret plots (Im working on 7-8) dedication to our mission, open hatred of the Black Riders (keep it in civil tongue).
