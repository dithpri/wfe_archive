We prefer to settle debates over a few pints from the local brewery. Nations aspiring to join should have a high culture level, as it is needed to make a jolly good ale or bitter. Also, as the pub is known as one of the working classes&#39; favourite place to be at after a long day, there must be quite reasonable levels of equality throughout the country. Psychotic madmen are welcome with open arms, but dishonourable,cowardly or biggoted-facist-arsefaces will HAVE THEIR FACES RIPPED OFF BY THE MIGHTY RED FIST OF COMMUNISM.
