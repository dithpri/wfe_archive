The Order of Eden is new region for all theocrats, military orders, monastic orders, (pseudo)-papacies, and all other forms of religious nation-states!

An RP heavy group, the Order of Eden is open to all those whose nation has a basis with an Abrahamic faith. Muslims, Jews, Catholics, Protestants, all brethren are welcome! However, roleplay of nations to be antagonistic towards each other (for example Muslim and Christian nations) is allowed and welcomed, but let it be known that while we may have our differences, we stand united against true heretics and the secular, atheistic forces of other regions and nations.

(While roleplay is encouraged, discrimination, racism, and bigotry will not be tolerated.)
