The Eiji District, where the city&#39;s politicos gather in the Jade Pavillion to do the work of running the city,
The Fu District, where the city&#39;s merchants gather in massive open air markets to drive the cities economy and sell their wares,
The Kuboda District, where the city&#39;s poor live packed together like sardines in a can,
The Shou District, where the less desirable elements of the city have gathered since time immemorable, 
and The Wukong District, where the city&#39;s priests and religious types gather to chant their devotions to the gods and the spirits that serve them.
