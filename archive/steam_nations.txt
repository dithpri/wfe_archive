A Steampunk-themed alternate dimension, where true lovers of the Steampunk genre can come and wage war against each other in peace.  Be prepared for roleplay, frequent conversations, and a general hatred of cheese.  We welcome all new nations, but be prepared to adopt the Steampunk genre, airships aren&amp;#39;t required, but they are accepted as a start to &amp;quot;becoming Steampunk&amp;quot;.
