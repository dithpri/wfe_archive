A Steampunk-themed alternate dimension taking place on the world of Eldaria, where true lovers of the Steampunk genre can come and wage war against each other in peace.  Be prepared for roleplay, frequent conversations, and a general hatred of cheese.  We welcome all new nations, but be prepared to adopt the Steampunk genre, airships aren&amp;#39;t required, but they are accepted as a start to &amp;quot;becoming Steampunk&amp;quot;.
