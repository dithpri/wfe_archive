[b]Look, guys...this is not how you do it. Really...mimicking TBR? I mean, be original, maybe? TBR is good at what they do, but some variety is nice.

Be more tailored to your target, when you can. Take some tips from the [region]Europeia[/region]n Republican Navy on style points, because you guys don&amp;#39;t score any of those at the moment.
