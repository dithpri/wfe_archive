UNK United Nations of Karm&oslash;y is a small and fine region mostly constructed for Nations to work together as allies

All the Nations are required to be from the Great Island of Karm&oslash;y to be able to join the UNK.

In the United Nations of Karm&oslash;y, no one is left alone by themselves, if a nation gets struck by the enemy, the UNK will strike back harder. but since merely 50% of the region can&amp;#39;t handle their economy, i suggest the rich countries keep their wealth to them selves, our goal as of now is to grow larger and more mightier than our upcoming Arch enemy &amp;quot;haugalandet&amp;quot; we will show them what it means to work united.
