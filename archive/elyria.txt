We are a region dedicated to the growth of Socialism and equality. We have 3 simple rules. 1. You must be Socialist to enter, otherwise you will be banned. 2. Follow NationStates TOS. 3. Refrain from swearing in the message board. Nothing else is compulsory, however we do encourage participating in activities, and endorsing our Founder [nation]Andripa[/nation], as well as switching your currency to the krone (that way we all share a currency).
We are temporarily password locked.
