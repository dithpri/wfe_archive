[i]In the smoldering wake of the Great War&#39;s protracted carnage (1914-1920), our world fractures into radical new contours. Marxist Scandinavians purge Stockholm&#39;s liberals, occult warlords carve Burgundy from war-torn France, and Sino-Russian hybrid states reclaim Asia from crumbling empires. Across the Atlantic, a revolutionary &quot;People&#39;s Republic&quot; swallows Quebec while drought-ravaged Texans forge water communes along the Rio Grande. This is an era of ideological fever dreams &#150; where Wilson&#39;s betrayed promises fuel anti-colonial fires, dust storms choke capitalist heartlands, and every armistice breeds three new rebellions. The old order lies in ashes; the new struggles to be born.[/i]
