The Athenian Sovereign Nations is a group of nations with no unified constitution but rather united under an age old treaty of a mutual alliance and cooperation. Each member nation is given complete freedom on how to manage and control his or her territory. 

At the event that the region falls under DEFCON 3 status, Emergency Powers are given to the Delagate and all member nations are obligated to cooperate as a State of Emergency is declared.
