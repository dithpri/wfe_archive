&quot;The role of a leader is not to come up with all the great ideas. The role of a leader is to create an environment in which great ideas can happen.&quot;

&#147;What is that feeling when you&#146;re driving away from people and they recede on the plain till you see their specks dispersing? &#150; it&#146;s the too-huge world vaulting us, and it&#146;s good-bye. But we lean forward to the next crazy venture beneath the skies.&#148;
