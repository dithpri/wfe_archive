The Federated Region of Terrawalk is a politically diverse and geographically expansive territory composed of multiple sovereign nations committed to cooperation, competition, and conflict resolution through peaceful and strategic means. Bordered by vast oceans, mountain ranges, deserts, and fertile plains, Terrawalk represents one of the most complex and interconnected geopolitical landscapes in the known world.

Terrawalk was founded under the Treaty of New Foundations, an accord signed by early pioneering nations with a shared vision: to &#147;walk forward together&#148; in shaping the future of civilization through geography, diplomacy, and development.
