&amp;quot;The Crimson Dawn&amp;quot;
What is mine shall come back to me
as water of the glaciar peak to the sea
so does the great law of love operates
time and distance shrink to let the likes meet

Stars in the sky come to a great fest at night
in clusters and constellations to play love games
orchestra to play and dance in translucent light
holding each others arms in spirals in fixed frames

Wink and blink to send signals across the space
to near and dear ones before they hide their face
in the rainbow hues of the advancing light of morn
suffusing the horizon and the hills in the crimson dawn.
