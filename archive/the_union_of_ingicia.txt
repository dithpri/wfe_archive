[hr][i][color=green]~~History~~[/color][/i]
For centuries, the people of Ingicia has suffered many pains and troubles from the people who dominated the realm. The people soon had enough, and decided to spring up into rebellion, but we are anything but unified, and the oppressors crushed us easily.

Now, our opressors dead, we shall now try to unify ourselves and survive, and not being tortured by what is our strong enemies.

This is the Union of Ingicia.
