Nortzagan is a nature filled region with phenomenal, worn down bits of the old castle of Majack, when Nortzgan was just found, and at the time was called Ajasha. Nortzgan also has many unique and quirky foods. Do not eat anything in the wild, for some will make you die. If you stay in the cities or lets say establishments made by you guys, you can eat anything. So be careful!
