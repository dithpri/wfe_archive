We believe that the world is made up of good, kind, caring people with the best intentions. We believe in progressive laws, civil liberties, and open democracy, as well as the idea that a nation should be able to peacefully govern its nation as it sees fit. Everyone is free to run their nation as they please, we only ask that you do not criticize others for how they may choose to run theirs. We will choose to remain a peaceful region. We will always protect these rights and the nations who choose to follow them. We believe that if this goal should ever be lost, than we will dissolve our nation for the purpose that your nations may find a better one. Long live peace.
