The Galactic Republic, commonly referred to as the Republic and before known as the New World Order, was the democratic union that governed the World for a thousand years prior to the rise of the United Nations. Centered on the Core World of Luxusbouerg, the Galactic Senate&#151;a body of legislators who represented the numerous Regions throughout the World&#151;governed the Republic under the leadership of the democratically elected Supreme Chancellor. Throughout its history, the Republic was protected by the Phoenix Order, an organization of Force-sensitives who served as the guardians of peace and justice, enabling the Republic to be free of full-scale conflict for most of its existence.
