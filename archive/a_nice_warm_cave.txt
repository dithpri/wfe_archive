[i]&amp;quot;Why not stay and camp out with us?&amp;quot;[/i]

That actually sounds like a great idea. Thanks for the invitation. Sadly, we can&amp;#39;t stay long. But we&amp;#39;d be happy to leave some cave paintings for you. How about a nice one of a Black Hawk, right over here in the corner? Looks nice to me. :)
