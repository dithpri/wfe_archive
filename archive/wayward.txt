We will rise above the noise and confusion and get a glimpse beyond this illusion, we can soar ever higher and maybe fly too high. On a stormy sea of regional devotion tossed about we&#39;re like ships on the ocean so set a course for winds of fortune and if you hear my voice say....come and join Wayward, son. There&#39;ll be peace if you come let your weary head rest that&#39;s what this region is for.

Looking for a Region without rules, a place where you and your nation can be yourselves. Well search no longer, Wayward is they place for those too stubborn to join a Region or just looking for one that fits. All are welcome so feel free to join. (The addition of Movie and TV nerds is deeply appreciated however not mandatory)
