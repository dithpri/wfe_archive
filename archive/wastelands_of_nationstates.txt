The Wastelands of NationStates shall be a democratic region run by the people as a frontier. No regular elections will be held and Delegates can be elected or unelected for as long as the people shall wish. In the event of a raid, please endorse YOUR trusted Delegate to restore the region. Thank you.

(This WFE shall be subject to the proposed changes of the people)

Founder&#146;s message to the people:

Make this region whatever you want it to be. Please have fun creating a society for everyone. I can&#146;t wait to see what everyone comes up with. Thank you!
