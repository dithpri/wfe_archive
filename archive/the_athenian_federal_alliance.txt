The Athenian Federal Alliance (AFA) is a region of nation-states united under one goal: Prosperity. Each leader is given complete freedom on how their nation progresses except when the region is in a state of emergency. That is the only time each nation is required to cooperate and contribute. Nonetheless, for as long as each nation moves forward towards their own state of utopia, the AFA will progress forward with it. 

All nations are encouraged to join the World Assembly and take part in the international community. Spread the glory of our nation to others and if you deem them to be beneficial to our cause, invite them.
