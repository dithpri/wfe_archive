[u][b][color=blue]Welcome to the one and only IAU[/color][/b][/u]
[i]The forgotten International Union...[/i]

The region has been abandoned for the time being. Nations residing here who wish to be apart of an active region are strongly urged to move to an International Union region.
However, if there is enough interest for the revitalization of this region, then a regional government will be established.

The IAU is a brother region to:
[region]International Northern Union[/region]
[region]International Southern Union[/region]
And our mother region, [region]International Western Union[/region]
