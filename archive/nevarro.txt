[color=green]Nevarro was a terrestrial planet with rocky and volcanic terrain. By 9 ABY, Nevarro was an independent world and a backwater best known as the home of the Bounty Hunters&#39; Guild. The Guild&#39;s leader, Greef Karga, was an influential figure in a settlement on the planet. The same settlement was also the location of a Mandalorian enclave and a small contingent of Imperials belonging to Gideon&#39;s Imperial remnant

After acquiring several bounties for the Bounty Hunters&#39; Guild, the bounty hunter known as the Mandalorian visited Nevarro to meet with Greef Karga, exchanging the bounties for money.[/color]
