Headed by the young Military Order of Sprungus - itself once a bastion of classical liberalism in the South Pacific before the surprise victory of an ultra-conservative in the most recent election - this region seeks to reclaim traditional Catholic holy territories. Critics describe the realm as a theocracy, a title the ruler - or Grand Master as he styles himself - has embraced. The Papacy has refused to support or condemn this new movement and the Grand Master&#39;s growing militaristic order has drawn massive support from across the Catholic world. World leaders express concerns that a new age of religious extremism is now inevitable.
