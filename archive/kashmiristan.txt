Kashmiristan is a lost continent forged in war and fire. It was one hundred years of total isolation until we met a new world. So many paintings to see, flowers to smell, candies to taste. So many wonderful things we had never seen before! We developed a friendship with the eighth continent, Asia. Our people moved there, settling in near India. Even thoug we were just a tiny speck in the subcontinent of India, we felt so big with so many things to discover.
