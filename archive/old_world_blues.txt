This region is based on an idea I had while playing hoi4, the old world blues mod. What if ... all the nations were player-controlled? And what if they were all player-designed? This region will give roleplay opportunities most similar to playing a grand strategy game on the broken east coasts of Canada, Mexico, and the United States after Fallout&#39;s &quot;Great War&quot;. Looking forward to new members and interested parties joining the community.
