The A.P.W.F, or Alliance in Pursuit of World Freedom, was founded by the Republic of Briton, in the interest of making it easier for Republics to network and bring freedom to people of oppressed nations. Anyone is welcome, as long as your government gives the people a voice. This will never be a Giant Alliance, as we value connection between members. While other regions will automatically invite you and throw you into a forum with hundreds of other nations, then forget about you, we want to form bonds between nations.
