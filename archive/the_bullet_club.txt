What I&#39;m doing, mixing rp and politics. Whenever I want to kill time I go to Palringo,A huge chat app that is so much simpler than those complicated forums. I want to make a huge rp clan that I can call a family. I was wondering if you&#39;d want to help build this family, linking pal and ns. Maybe we can spread to other places like kik and other chats. What do you think?
