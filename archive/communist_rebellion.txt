[b][color=black][i]&quot;Socialism states that you owe me something simply because I exist. Capitalism, by contrast, results in a sort of reality-forced altruism: I may not want to help you, I may dislike you, but if I don&#39;t give you a product or service you want, I will starve. Voluntary exchange is more moral than forced redistribution.&quot;
