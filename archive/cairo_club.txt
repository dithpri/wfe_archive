I have made my way into the Royal Palace, and it was the Bird-Fly who brought me hither.

Hail to thee, who fliest up to Heaven, to give light to the stars and protect the White Crown which falleth to me.

Stable art thou, O mighty god, for ever. Make thou for me a path upon which I may pursue my course.
