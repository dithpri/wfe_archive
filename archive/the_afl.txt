[b]The AFL (More commonly known as The Anti-Fascist League) is a conglomerate of nations whose goal is to neutralize fascism by any means possible. We do ,on occasion, team up with some fascists so that we can defeat a larger threat but this is rare. We are not necessarily opposed to right-wing libertarians but we do view them with some suspicion. The acceptable political stances are right-wing libertarianism, left-wing authoritarianism (Just about) and left-wing libertarianism. If peace is viable option then so be it but if war is the only option then may the fury of our region rain down on all who stand in our path! [/b]
