[color=red][b]Welcome to the AFL (Also known as the Anti-Fascist League but not to be mistaken with Australian Football League)! We are a far-left organisation determined on making the world a better place through the destruction of right-wing authoritarian Nazis who believe themselves superior to others and want to make the world in their image. We do not want to inflict our beliefs on anyone else but to stop others from doing just that. We have nothing against right-wing libertarians or left-wing authoritarians but we have no interest in partaking in trade or embassies.[/b][/color]

[color=green][b] We prefer to be left alone so please don&#39;t send any embassy requests, we will send them to you. Also any rumors saying that we a partaking in spying on other regions is untrue[/b][/color]
