[color=Blue][b][u]Antarchon-[/u][/b][/color]
Doorway to the Antarctic Circle, beautiful Antarchon is  subject to summer rains, and heavy winter snows. Though occasionally dreary the region is known for its hard nosed Isolationist Occupants who pride themselves on their regional heritage. Though surrounded on two of four sides by Slowly receding glaciers, the region stands ready to face the world once again.
