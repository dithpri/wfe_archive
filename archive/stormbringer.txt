Stormbringer is a Region dedicated to warlords, battles, and brave last stands; but mixed with preposterous signature attacks, long-winded philosophic debates during combat, and satirical wit.  In short, it&amp;#39;s a Region for Bad Asses (real, self proclaimed, or perceived), although all types of nations are welcome.  It&amp;#39;s important to take yourself seriously, but not too seriously.
