The Obsidian Islands, originally referred to as the Isle of Obsidian by early explorers due to the area&amp;#39;s many extinct volcanoes, was settled to serve as a tropical trading hub within the Capricorn-Pacific region. Its relative isolation and equidistant positioning between the large developed continents allowed the Obsidian Islands to benefit from trade from many world superpowers. As a result, the region has prospered with its rapidly growing nations developing at substantial rates.
