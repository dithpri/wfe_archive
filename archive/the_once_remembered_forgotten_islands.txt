[b]Welcome to The Once Remembered Forgotten Islands![/b]
A lush archipelago consisting of a few loosely connected nations, the Once Remembered Forgotten Islands used to be a place of importance economically and historically, but due to a number of cartography errors and worldwide miscommunication, the islands no longer exist on world maps, and were quickly forgotten by the larger regions of the world.

The islands are the actual home of the internationally famous Pigmy Love Circus, though the Confederacy of Wizzyloke disputes that claim.
