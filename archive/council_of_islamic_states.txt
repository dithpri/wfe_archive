On Ramadan 27, 1441 AH, the [region]Council of Islamic States[/region] merged with the [region]United Empire of Islam[/region] under a joint agreement between [nation]Nikitan[/nation] and [nation]Western Arab Empire[/nation], the executive authorities of the respective regions. 

All former CoIS members are encouraged to join the [region]United Empire of Islam[/region].

We wish to enable the preservation of the CoIS community and the unity between the Muslims of NationStates. United we stand, divided we fall.
