The Council of Islamic States was established on Dhul Hijjah 8, 1438 AH by the Caliph [nation=noflag]Hadhari[/nation] on the ideals of moderation, cooperation, and tolerance. For three years, CoIS stood as one of NationStates&#39; greatest Islamic regions.

On Ramadan 27, 1441 AH, the [region]Council of Islamic States[/region] merged with the [region]United Empire of Islam[/region] under a joint agreement between [nation=noflag]Nikitan[/nation] and [nation=noflag]Western Arab Empire[/nation], the executive authorities of the respective regions. Special thanks to [nation=noflag]Slovenya[/nation] and [nation=noflag]Kawther[/nation] for making this merger possible. 

All former CoIS members are encouraged to join the [region]United Empire of Islam[/region]. We wish to enable the preservation of the CoIS community and the unity between the Muslims of NationStates. 

United we stand, divided we fall.
