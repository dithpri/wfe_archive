Region hub for [nation]Fhaengshia[/nation]

Embassies are with regions of card players I am friends with and my other regions

[hr]

List of my regions for puppet storage:
[region]Ascetic Aesthetics[/region]
[region]6 bit RGB[/region]
[region]Violin Sonatas by Mozart[/region]
[region]Other Defaults[/region]
[region]Ejecting[/region]
[region]A Good Nights Rest[/region]

If I ask for an embassy it is because a member of your region has a card I would like to purchase and I can&#39;t send a puppet there to request.
