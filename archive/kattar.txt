Kattar is a quiet corner of the world. Its most notable triumph was defeating members of the extremist group, the Kataliban.  The Kataliban deemed rubber squeaky mice inferior to mice covered with rabbit fur, and attempted to drive all squeaky mice out of Kattar.  Rubber mice and furry mice united to drive them from Kattar, and now all are having a nice lie-down in true Katgani style.  ;)  Kattar is sister region to Katasia, whom she considers a close ally.

Katganistan may be on tour in Katasia at any moment, but never fear:  she will return!
