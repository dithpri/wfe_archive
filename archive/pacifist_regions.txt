This region is to form alliances/embassies with pro-peace regions. Any regions with the pacifist tag will likely be accepted and others possibly on a case by case basis.

This region is part of the peace Network.
Go to the region &quot;regions&quot;for more information.

Currently, 1.5976% of the regions at nation states have a pacifist tag. However, that&#39;s a good start I suppose.
