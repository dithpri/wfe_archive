The wind carries the sound of distant Fiddling, urging your feet to dance as you step into the realm of [nation=noflag]The Fiddler[/nation], a Fae deity who long ago laid claim to the souls of all those who died upon the sea, at least until they were opposed by the accursed Davy Jones; who began to steal the souls of those whose blood was spilled by violence upon the waves. 

Fiddler&#39;s Green is a peaceful realm, a festive realm, where every night brings a party, and every morning a feast.
