Howdy! This region is dedicated to people who want to roleplay and write tales about their country in a WW1-inspired fantasy setting.

Discord: Most of our Nation-State related stuff as far as interactions go will be hosted on Discord, feel free to join to know more about the universe this region is set in! This Discord also doubles as a roleplaying server I own, so feel free to get into that if you like the sound of it. It&#39;s also where you can find the lore. - https://discord.gg/axQbqd3

Map: We&#39;re planning on adding a visual map soon.

Story-Writing: There is a public space on the Discord for writing stories about stories set in this universe, I would love to read what any of you could come up with!
