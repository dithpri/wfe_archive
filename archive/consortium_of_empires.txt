Welcome... to the underworld. *evil smile* the world is made of two people, the strong and the weak. it is the weak peoples purpose to serve the strong. It always will be. We deal in many things... drugs, guns, slave trades, assassinations, even over-throwing governments for profit. Oh don&amp;#39;t worry... we aren&amp;#39;t all bad... really. We have legal businesses, our foundries push out cars and tanks, we build casinos that touch the heavens and even mine the asteroids. we are the strong... are you?
