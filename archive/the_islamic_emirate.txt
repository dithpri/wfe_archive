Hello!

We are a people that believe that there is absolutely none worthy of worship except [b]Allah[/b] (glory be to Him) and his final messenger is [b]Muhammad[/b] (peace and blessings be upon him). We strictly adhere to the [b]Sharia[/b], [b]Qur&#39;an[/b] and [b]Sunnah[/b].

It was narrated from Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (&amp;#65018;) said:

Best sources of guidance to the world are: The [url=https://quran.com/]Qur&#39;an[/url] and the [url=https://sunnah.com/]Sunnah[/url] of the prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

[u]Peace to those who seek peace![/u]&amp;#127988;&amp;#127987;&amp;#65039;
