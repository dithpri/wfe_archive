Hello!

We are a people that believe that there is absolutely none worthy of worship except &#139;Allah&#155; -  glory be to Him - and his final messenger is Muhammad upon him be peace. We strictly adhere to the &#139;Sharia&#155;, &#139;Qur&#39;an&#155; and &#139;Sunnah&#155;.

&laquo;Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, &#147;Islam began as something strange and it will return to being strange, so blessed are the strangers.&#148;&raquo;

[u]Peace to those who seek peace![/u]
