Legend has told of a mythical Senator who transcended space and time, cleansing the sweet mother Pacifica of all those who sought to sully her purity with substandard nations.  His tireless efforts are a selfless service for all to behold.  Hearken to his call, and join him in his pursuit.  Ne&#39;er again shall such a being exist.  Pay tribute to him with hugs, and other such affections.  Hail Pergamon! Hail Pacifica!
