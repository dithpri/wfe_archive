[color=blue]Discord is a proprietary freeware VoIP application and digital distribution platform designed for video gaming communities, that specializes in text, image, video and audio communication between users in a chat channel. Discord runs on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, and in web browsers.

FUN FACT: Upon finding out that discord was one of the platforms used for the &quot;Unite the Right&quot; rally in Charlottesville, discord quickly shut down the server and issued a &quot;Love, Not Hate&quot; message on its twitter. 

Discord is Anti Nazi/Fascist :D
