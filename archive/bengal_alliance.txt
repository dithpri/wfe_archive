Welcome to Bengal Alliance

A region primarily for Bengali speaking nations
Bengali is the seventh most spoken first language in the world.
The language boasts of a variety of poetry, prose, cinema and art
Here, we celebrate the language and the people of Bengal.

Chill here. Discuss art. Talk about science. Debate political issues. Have a fish-fry. Leave a puppet.

Keeping pace with our history of accepting various cultures and blending them with our own,
Entry to Bengal is open to everyone.
