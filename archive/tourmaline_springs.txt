A wreath of leaves upon your head
You&#39;ve achieved your goal just like you said
On top of the world with much dismay
All you wish is to leave and go far away
You want an escape, no, that can&#39;t be true
But it is, you feel smothered by all you&#39;ve been through
You trampled on family, you stepped on your friends
But all of their suffering is means to an end
You feel bad, but what&#39;s done is done
But a guilty mind forgives no one.
So come to a place, where everyone else has the same two faces
When you look at a neighbor, you look at a mirror,
And as you look in their eyes, only then do you realize
You&#39;re true color&#39;s always been black.
You&#39;re true color doesn&#39;t have to be black.
