The United Nations of Quoidge is a region formed after years of warring between six great Continents, after the war settled down the previous companionships had been decimated, and relations between countries destroyed. However, Vakrish saw this as an opportunity to create a new unification under Governments and Nations for all, no matter how far split the Governments are. The United Nations of Quoidge accepts all under its care, and is notable for having an extremely prominent defense force as well as cash funding, most coming from Vakrish itself.

Glory to Quoidge, Down with the Corrupt!
